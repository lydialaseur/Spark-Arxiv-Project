Most of existing latching mechanisms are based on physical tools such as hooks, cages or magnets, which limit the payload capacity. Therefore, robots require a latching mechanism which can help to reconfigure itself without sacrificing the payload capability. \n\nThis paper presents a latching mechanism based on the flexible screw attaching principle. In which, actuators are used to move the robot links and joints while connecting them with a motorized-screw and disconnecting them by unfastening the screw. \nThe brackets used in our mechanism configuration helps to hold maximum force up to $5000N$. \nThe LaMMos - Latching Mechanism based on Motorized- screw has been applied to the DeWaLoP - Developing Water Loss Prevention  in-pipe robot. It helps the robot to shrink its body to crawl into the pipe with minimum diameter, by reconfiguring the leg positions. And it helps to recover the legs positions to original status once the robot is inside the pipe. Also, LaMMos add stiffness to the robot legs by dynamically integrate them to the structure.\n\nAdditionally, we present an application of the LaMMos mechanism to exoskeleton suits, for easing the motors from the joints when carrying heavy weights for long periods of time.\n\n \nThis mechanism offers many interesting opportunities for robotics research in terms of functionality, payload and size.\n\n\n\n\\keywords{Reconfigurable Robot \\and Latching Mechanism \\and In-pipe  Robots \\and Exoskeleton Suits}% \\and Humanoid  Robots }\n% \\PACS{PACS code1 \\and PACS code2 \\and more}\n% \\subclass{MSC code1 \\and MSC code2 \\and more}\n\\end{abstract}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{INTRODUCTION}\n\n%Self-reconfigurable robots are autonomous kinematic machines with variable morphology. Beyond conventional actuation, sensing and control typically found in fixed-morphology robots, self-reconfiguring robots are also able to deliberately change their own shape by rearranging the connectivity of their parts, in order to adapt to new circumstances, perform new tasks, or recover from damage \\cite{intro123123}.\n%By saying "self-reconfigurable" it means that the mechanism or device is capable of utilizing its own system of control such as with actuators or stochastic means to change its overall structural shape \\cite{4141950}.\n\n\n\n   \\begin{figure*}%[thpb]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.95 \\textwidth]{fig1.jpg}\n      \\caption{ Aluminum profiles representing the robot body where the LaMMos mechanism will be installed. \n      1) Aluminum profile with a special groove.\n      2) T-Slot nut.\n      3) The T-Slot nut is inserted into the profile groove.\n      4) The T-Slot nut is set and trapped inside the profile groove.\n      5) Bracket attached by driving the screw into the inserted T-Slot nut inside the profile. \n      6) LaMMos bracket attached to the aluminum profile with a motorized screw to the T-Slot nut. }\n      \\label{profiles}\n   \\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nIn order to be better adapted to various sized targets or complex geometric requirements, it is desirable that robots used in modern mechanical systems are geometrically reconfigurable. It means that the topological structure, kinematic parameters or dynamic parameters of the mechanism may be adjustable during the motion process \\cite{5173816}.\nA reconfigurable robot consists of a collection of individual links and joint components that can be assembled into multiple robot geometries. Compared to a conventional industrial robot with fixed geometry, such a system is able to provide flexibility, enabling itself to cope with a wide spectrum of tasks through proper selection and reconfiguration of a large inventory of functional components \\cite{conro}.\n\nAdditionally, to the geometrical adjustment, in some cases, it is expected that the robot become stronger if it reconfigures its structure in order to carry loads beyond its initial capability or maintain its position passively and not actively consuming energy from the actuators.\n\nCommonly, these reconfigurable mechanisms join the robot links with a latching mechanism, such as  hooks, cages or magnets \\cite{crossball} \\cite{Superbot} \\cite{Miche} \\cite{singo}. In this way, the mechanism is fast to attach and flexible to connect. %, however, lacks of payload capacity.\nHowever, it has the limitation of restricting the payload capacity.\n%In following sections we will present the existing latching mechanisms used in reconfigurable system. \nOne can categorize them into two types, magnetic latching and physical latching.\n\\\\\n\\\\*\n\\textbf{Magnetic latching}\\\\*\nMiche  (Modular Shape Formation by Self-Disassembly)  \\cite{Miche} includes a connection mechanism by switchable magnets, able to connect to a neighbor�s steel plate and can support $2kg$. A similar latching mechanism is the M-TRAN (Self-Reconfigurable Modular Robotic System) \\cite{mtran}, which is composed of nonlinear springs, Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) coils and magnets fixed on a moving part (connecting plate), able to lift two modules within the actual torque limit ($23kg$-$cm$).\nAs a result, the payload supported by these magnetics latching mechanism is relatively low if compared to physical latching connection mechanism.\n\\\\\n\\\\*\n\\textbf{Physical latching}\\\\*\nA. Sproewitz \\cite{4543747} presents a robust and heavy duty physical latching connection mechanism, which can ben seen as a hook with clamping principles. It can be actuated with DC motors to actively connect and disconnect modular robot units with load up to $18Kg$. \n\nSimilar, the Superbot \\cite{Superbot} module consists of six connectors, one on each side of the end effectors. Any of the six connectors of the Superbot module can connect to any connectors of another module with orientation intervals of 90$^\\circ$.\nThe module\'s drivetrain for each degree-of-freedom (DOF) includes %The drive train of each degree of freedom of a module consists of \na DC electric motor, a planetary gearbox, and an external gearbox, resulting in a maximum of $6.38Nm$ torque.\nGiven the size and weight of each module, this amount of torque is enough for reliably lifting three neighboring modules. \n\nJL-1 \\cite{5173891} is a reconfigurable multi-robots system based on parallel and cone-shaped docking mechanisms. It is used for joining mobile robots to each other, in order to adopt a reconfigurable chain structure to cope with the cragged landforms which are difficult to overcome for a single robot.\nTherefore, when two robots are linked, a full motorized spherical joint is formed.\nThis mechanism requires two motors on the docking side and one more motor on the driving platform connection. \n\nIn contrast to the presented state of the art in latching mechanism, the LaMMos - Latching Mechanism based on Motorized-screw mechanism is able to support payloads up to $500kg$ and requires only one motor to make connection.\n\nThis paper describes the design and development of the LaMMos mechanism. \nAdditionally, a couple of applications are presented, \none for the DeWaLoP in-pipe robot and another for exoskeleton suits. \n\nFor the DeWaLoP in-pipe robot, the LaMMos mechanism helps the robot to shrink its body to crawl into the pipe with minimum diameter, by reconfiguring the leg positions. And it helps to recover the legs positions as original once the robot is inside the pipe. Also, the LaMMos mechanism is used for increase the stiffness of the robot legs by dynamically integrate them to the structure. \n\nAnother application of the LaMMos mechanism following the same principle of creating a rigid structure from movable joints is for exoskeleton suits \\cite{4058569} \\cite{6650376} \\cite{4291584}. The LaMMos can improve the payload capacity of exoskeletons when these are required to carry heavy weights for long periods of time. %in the same position.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Requirements for a latching mechanism in reconfigurable robot}\n\nThe aim of docking mechanism in reconfigurable robots is to attach/detach robot modules. \n%Several features a docking unit should be capable of can be distinguished \nThere are a few requirements that a latching mechanism should fulfill \\cite{intro} \\cite{crossball} \\cite{Superbot} \\cite{Miche}.\nHowever, the relevance of each single feature differs, depending on the functionality of the robot itself. \nHere we list the common requirements for a docking or connection mechanism used in self reconfiguration robots.\n\n%In general, the following listed features are important for self-reconfigurable robots and should be provided by the bonding mechanism \\cite{goodintro}:\n\n   \\begin{figure*}%[thpb]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.88 \\textwidth]{fig2.jpg}\n      \\caption{ Comparison of LaMMos standard (left) and simplified mechanisms (right). \n      1.

This feature  is important for modular robots. Due that modules must be able to lock/unlock in any position. However, LaMMos is intended only for self-reconfigurable robot with predefined locking points.\n\n\n\n%===========================================================\n%===========================================================\n\\section{LaMMos Mechanism}\n\nThe LaMMos mechanisms enables robots to reconfigure its structure without loosing its payload capacity as other common latching mechanisms do. \nAlso, the LaMMos mechanism enable robot joints to become rigid within its structure in order to handle heavy weight loads for long periods of time without loosing energy and protecting its movable actuators.\n\nThe LaMMos mechanism adopts the flexible screw attaching principle for connecting or disconnecting robot parts.\nIt can be applied to any robots having rigid materialized surface, such as aluminum profiles, \nin which a T-Slot nut can be locked for further connection with brackets, as shown in Fig. \\ref{profiles}. Moreover, LaMMos can be included in any type of bracket, such as flat, right angle, box, etc. Also, multiple LaMMos can be included in the same bracket, see Fig. \\ref{LaMMosTypes}.\n\nThe LaMMos mechanism mimics the human operation of constructing robot links on the robot body by tightening a screw over a nut inside the body, and deconstructing the robot links by driving the screw out of the body.\n\n\n   \\begin{figure}%[thpb]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.47 \\textwidth]{fig3.jpg}\n      \\caption{ LaMMos driving mechanism.\n      a) Geared motor with resin socket for hexagonal head screw.\n      b) Geared motor with screw integrated.\n      c) Geared motor encapsulated with guiding tube.}\n      \\label{hareconsistof}\n   \\end{figure}\n\n\n   \\begin{figure*}%[thpb]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.95 \\textwidth]{fig4.jpg}\n      \\caption{LaMMos mechanism integrated in brackets.\n      a) LaMMos mechanism.\n      b) LaMMos flat-bracket.\n      c) LaMMos right-angle bracket.\n      d) Multiple LaMMos inside a box-bracket.}\n      \\label{LaMMosTypes}\n   \\end{figure*}\n\n\n\nThe main constituting elements of the LaMMos mechanism are divided into two main parts, the active part and passive part. The active part includes all the elements around the bracket: geared motor, screw, flexible nut, a compressed springs, a guiding tube %moldable rubber, couple of compressed springs, couple of guiding tubes \nand the bracket itself, as shown in Fig. \\ref{hareconsistof15}. The passive part is the T-slot nut inserted into the robot body, or any device inside of the robot body that provide a nut for the screw.\n\n\nThe presented LaMMos mechanism is a simplified version of the standard LaMMos mechanism \\cite{Ref:DeWaLoP_ICAR2013}. The main differences between these two versions are in the guiding mechanism. Since the motorized-screw is the same.\n\nIn the standard LaMMos version, the guiding mechanism includes a couple of compressed springs, two guiding rails and a moldable rubber inside the hole of the bracket. Whereas, in the simplified LaMMos, the guiding mechanism includes only one compressed spring, one guiding rail and a spring acting as a flexible nut located inside the hole of the bracket for guiding the motorized-screw.\n\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{T-Slot nut}\\\\*\nThe T-Slot nut is used for securing heavy components in fastening applications.\nThe T-Slot nuts are inserted into the profile groove where they are secured in position by driving a screw into it.\nIt will stay secure with holding up maximum force up to $5000N$, as shown in  Fig. \\ref{profiles}.\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{Driving mechanism - motorized-screw}\\\\*\nThe driving mechanism consists of a micro-geared motor with an integrated screw.\nThe geared motor specifications are in table \\ref{motorspec}.\n\n\nThe screw is an hexagonal head $M8$ with a length of $18mm$.\nA plastic resin is modeled to join the geared motor with the screw. It fits the motor shaft and the hexagonal screw head, as shown in Fig. \\ref{hareconsistof}$a$ and Fig. \\ref{hareconsistof}$b$.\n\nThe geared motor is encapsulated in a cylinder \nwith radius of $27mm$ and length of height of $40mm$. The capsule includes a $6mm$ hole for the guiding system of the motorized-screw.\n\n\\begin{table}[thpb] \n\\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n    \\hline\n    Dimensions  & length = $33.2mm$  \\\\ \n    ~  & width = $14mm$  \\\\ \n    ~  & height = $14mm$   \\\\ \\hline\n    Gear ration  & 298:1   \\\\ \\hline\n    Stall Torque & $2884gm*cm$ at $3V$ \\\\ \n    ~ & $3444gm*cm$ at $6V$          \\\\ \\hline\n    Shaft        & $3mm$ diameter $D$ shaped         \\\\ \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Micro geared motor specifications.}\n    \\label{motorspec} \n    \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n%\\\\ \\\\*\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Guiding mechanism}\\\\*\nThe guiding mechanism of the simplified LaMMos consists of a single aluminum tube attached to the bracket, with diameter of $6mm$ and length of $70mm$. The tube crosses the cylinder where the geared motor is encapsulated, becoming its guiding rail in conjunction with the motorized-screw, as shown in Fig. \\ref{hareconsistof}$c$.\n\nIn addition, the LaMMos mechanism includes a compressed spring with length of $19mm$ and width of $8mm$ with side hooks, see Table \\ref{springsp}.\nThe function of the springs is to maintain the geared motor in touch with the bracket base when it tries to get out of it by rotating counterclockwise (unscrewing). In other words, the springs act as a pushing force for the motorized-screw to maintain its position when the screw gets loose. \n\n\n\\begin{table}[thpb] \n\\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\n    \\hline\n    Dimensions  & length = $19mm$  \\\\ \n    ~  & width = $8mm$  \\\\  \\hline\n    Diameter of spring wire, $d$  & $0.5mm$   \\\\ \\hline\n    Number of active coils, $n_a$  & $28mm$   \\\\ \\hline\n    Material & Stainless steel \\\\ \\hline\n    Weight  $M$ & $0.000406Kg$         \\\\ \\hline\n    Maximum load $F_{max}$ & $4.506N$         \\\\ \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Extension spring specifications.}\n    \\label{springsp} \n    \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n%\\\\ \\\\*\n\\noindent\n%There is an alternative configuration in which the compressed spring can be integrated in the LaMMos. It can be located at the top of the motorized-screw-capsule to a top roof linked to the guiding tube, as shown in Fig. \\ref{alternative}. \n\\textbf{Flexible nut}\\\\*\nA flexible nut is located inside the hole of the bracket. \nPhysically the flexible nut is similar to a torsion spring, it consists of a spring with one coil and with two opposite extension of the spring wires, which are inserted into the LaMMos bracket, as shown in figure \\ref{haremodes}. \nThe coil diameter is set to the diameter of the screw and the diameter of the wire is half millimeter diameter, so the thread of the screw is trapped. \nIn the previous LaMMos mechanisms the flexible nut functionality was done by a moldable rubber. However, the moldable rubber can wear out over time. \nSince the functionality of the flexible nut is to guide the screw up or down from the bracket hole.\n\n\n   \\begin{figure*}%[thpb]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.95 \\textwidth]{fig5.jpg}\n      \\caption{LaMMos mechanism in latching and unlatching status.\n      a)  Unlatching status.

The flexible nut acts as initial thread for the screw to tight the T-Slot nut.}\n      \\label{haremodes}\n   \\end{figure*}\n\n\nIn this way, the flexible nut acts in two different ways: \nhousing the screw and guiding the screw.\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{Housing the screw}\\\\*\n%\\subsubsection{Housing the screw}\nIn order to move the LaMMos bracket, the screw must be housed in unlatching status, preventing any accidental latching. \nThe screw is always pushed by the compressed springs towards the bracket, in order to maintain it over the bracket. With the friction provided by the flexible nut, the screw will not go straight through the bracket causing accidental latching, as shown in Fig. \\ref{haremodes}$a$. In this mode, the LaMMos is set as a movable part.\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{Guiding the screw to the T-Slot nut}\\\\*\n%\\subsubsection{Guiding the screw to the T-Slot nut}\nDuring the latching process, the flexible nut provides an initial thread inside the bracket for the screw to go through until it reaches the T-slot nut inside the fastening target (robot body). The flexible nut has the property of guiding thread,  so that the screw will not be stopped and tight with it  before it  reaches the T-slot, as shown in Fig. \\ref{haremodes}$b$.\n\n\n\nNext, we introduce the DeWaLoP in-pipe robot and recall the multiple use of LaMMos mechanism in the robot.\n\n\n%===========================================================\n%===========================================================\n%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\\section{DeWaLoP In-PIPE ROBOT}\n\nDeWaLoP stands for Developing Water Loss Prevention.\nThe goal of the DeWaLoP robot is to restore (repair, clean, etc,.) the over 100 years old pipe-joints of the fresh water supply systems of Vienna and Bratislava. \nThese pipelines range from $800$ to $1000mm$ diameters and are still in good metallurgical shape.

When compressing its wheeled-legs, the wheels become active and the maintenance unit is able to move along the pipe by the mobile robot.\n\nThe unit structure consists of six wheeled -legs, distributed in pairs of three, on each side, separated by an angle of 120$^{\\circ}$, supporting the structure along the center of the pipe, as shown in Fig. \\ref{dewalop}. The maintenance unit combines a wheel-drive-system with a wall-press-system, enabling the robot to operate in pipe diameters varying from $800mm$ to $1000mm$ \\cite{Ref:DeWaLoP_IROS2013}.

The first is to reconfigure the top wheeled-legs for easy input of the robot in the smaller pipe diameter. And the second is to add stiffness to the wheeled-legs once they are extended forming a centered structure inside the pipe. \\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{Easy robot insertion}\\\\*\nThe DeWaLoP robot has been designed to work in pipes with diameters ranging from $800mm$ to $1000mm$, where the robot is able to move and perform the redevelopment task. \nHowever, to insert the robot into the $800mm$ diameter pipe requires precision and effort, as the gas springs of each wheeled-leg must be compressed by $30mm$ for creating the space to enter the pipe, as shown in Fig. \\ref{xxxx}$a$. The compress force needs to be at least $400N$. %effort. \n%This is because all wheeled-legs must compress its $400N$ gas spring by $30mm$ for clearance of the legs to the pipe, as shown in Fig. \\ref{xxxx}. \nIn other words, the operators must push the robot into the pipe and at the same time push each of its wheeled-legs with a force $F\\geq400N$, to compress the springs and insert the robot into the $800mm$ diameter pipe.\n\n  \\begin{figure}[b]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.47 \\textwidth]{fig7.jpg}\n      \\caption{ DeWaLoP in-pipe robot front view. \n      a) Before installing the LaMMos mechanism, to insert the robot into the $800mm$ diameter pipe.

The wheeled-legs extend creating a centered structure. However, the maximum force the legs can hold is limited to linear actuator specifications. \n\nHence, if a locking mechanism attaches each wheeled-leg to the maintenance unit structure, then the dynamical structure formed by extending the legs increases its stiffness.\n\n%Hence, if once the wheeled-legs are extended, a locking mechanism attaches the wheeled-leg to the maintenance unit, then the dynamical structure form be extending the legs becomes a static one with higher rigidity.\n\n%Its rigidity is not optimal, since the stiffness is given by the wheeled-legs actuators capacity. %Consequently, this can be improved if a \n\n\nIn following sections we will first describe the structure of the robot wheeled-legs,  then how we install the two proposed LaMMos mechanism into the legs. \nFinally, we will present the procedure of our experiment showing how the LaMMos mechanism helps to reconfigure the robot and make it stronger.\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{Wheeled-leg before installing LaMMos}\\\\*\nA wheeled-leg in DeWaLop robot consists of the following components, see Fig. \\ref{wheeledlegs}.\n\n\n1) $Base$ profile. \n\n2) $Leg$ profile.\n\n3) $Wheel$ profile.\n\n4) Linear actuator.\n\n5) Gas spring.\n\n6) Angle bracket $80\\times80mm$.\n\n7) Angle bracket $40\\times40mm$.\n\n8) Angle bracket $V$.\n\n\nThe right-angle brackets are characterized by its high load-bearing capacity to overcome displacement, torsion and deflection.\nAs shown in Table \\ref{tab:anglefastenersforce}, where $F$ refers to the operating force that the bracket can hold, and $l$ refers to the length of the corresponding part attached by the bracket, see Fig. \\ref{wheeledlegsload}.\n%refers to the length of the corresponding part hold by the bracket.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht] \n\\begin{center}\n    \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\n    \\hline\n     Bracket 8  $40\\times40mm$  & $F<1000N \\wedge F \\times l < 50Nm$    \\\\ \\hline\n     Bracket 8  $80\\times80mm$  & $F<2000N \\wedge F \\times l < 150Nm$    \\\\ \\hline\n     Bracket 8  $160\\times80mm$  & $F<2000N \\wedge F \\times l < 150Nm$    \\\\ \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Load - carry capacity of the right angle bracket.}\n    %Right angle bracket load-carry capacity from applied Force $F$ and Length $l$. }\n    \\label{tab:anglefastenersforce} \n    \\end{center}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n   \\begin{figure}%[thpb]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.48 \\textwidth]{fig8.jpg}\n      \\caption{Wheeled-leg load - carry capacity of the right angle bracket.}\n      \\label{wheeledlegsload}\n   \\end{figure}\n\n\n   \\begin{figure} %[!t]\n      %\\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.48 \\textwidth]{fig9.jpg}\n      \\caption{a) Wheeled-leg (left side view), revealing the gas spring connected from the $wheel$ profile to the $leg$ profile. \n      b) Wheeled-leg (right side view), revealing the linear actuator for extending/contracting the leg. \n      c) Modified parts: The $80 \\times 80mm$ right-angle bracket is replaced by a LaMMos right-angle bracket.

At this point, the wheeled-leg is able to overcome forces up to $2000N$, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$b$. \n\n%The angle bracket is screw to the T-Slot nut and the maintenance unit is constructed to overcome the maximum force calculated, due to its structure and not due to its linking mechanism.\n\n{\\bf Step 2.} With the operation from the robot remote control, the robot moves into the pipe as it is positioned inside the pipe, see Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$b$. The linear actuators pull the wheeled-legs until the legs are perpendicular to the maintenance unit axis, see Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$c$. At this point the LaMMos right-angle brackets are at the right position but is not tight to the T-Slot nut inside the profile.\n\n\n{\\bf Step 3.} Then, the LaMMos mechanism activates the motorized-screw to rotate clockwise until the screw tights the T-Slot nut inside the maintenance unit, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$d$. \n\n%The LaMMos mechanism rotates the screw counterclockwise until housing the screw, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$c$. \n\n\n\n{\\bf Step 4.} The wheeled-legs are re-constructed, the LaMMos right-angle bracket has fasten the $base$ profile to the maintenance unit axis. Each of the wheeled-leg is able to overcome forces up to $2000N$, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$e$. \n\n\n{\\bf Step 5.} The robot is located inside the pipe and required to rehabilitate a pipe-joint. It extend all its wheeled-legs and once a centered structure has been reached, the LaMMos flat-bracket (integrated on all the wheeled-legs) are activated, connecting the $legs$ to the $base$ profiles of the maintenance unit. In this way, the $legs$ become part of the maintenance unit structure, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$g$. \nResulting in a rigid structure able to overcome higher forces that its movable actuators, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$h$. \n%Resulting in a rigid structure able to overcome forces up to $5000N$, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocess}$f$. \n\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{Evaluation of LaMMos mechanism}\\\\*\nIn the process of attaching the LaMMos bracket to the T-Slot nut inside the maintenance unit, the motorized-screw requires a power supply of $3V$ delivering a stall torque of $2884gm*cm$, which is enough to tight the bracket securely.\nWhile for unscrewing it, the supplied voltage of the motorized-screw is doubled ($6V$) with a stall torque of  $3444gm*cm$.%, so the mechanism is able to always unscrew itself. \n\n  \\begin{figure}[thpb]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.47 \\textwidth]{fig12.jpg}\n      \\caption{ Current (mA) / Time (t) plot from the LaMMos\'s geared motor. }\n      \\label{3dproceasdasdssx}\n   \\end{figure}\n\nAs shown in Fig. \\ref{3dproceasdasdssx}, initially the LaMMos is housing the screw, then the geared motor starts to rotate clockwise at voltage of $3V$. The screw starts to follow the thread from the flexible nut, crossing it and finally reaching the T-Slot nut.\nTo unscrew the motorized-screw, the voltage supply is doubled to $6V$. The geared motor reaches a peak current while starting to rotate counterclockwise. Once the screw is out of the T-Slot nut, the current stabilizes while the screw follows the thread of the flexible nut until it is housed inside the LaMMos bracket.\n\n\n\n   \\begin{figure}[b]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.47 \\textwidth]{fig13.jpg}\n      \\caption{Electric exoskeleton payload capacity demonstration.}\n      \\label{exo}\n   \\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{LaMMos for Exoskeleton Applications}\n\nAn exoskeleton is an external structural mechanism with joints and links corresponding to those of the human body \\cite{4291584}. \nThere are two main groups of exoskeletons, the ones with unlimited power supply including both wearable types with a tether or those fixed to a base \\cite{1639189} \\cite{5975512}.

On the other hand, exoskeletons with limited power supply must avoid positions that have high consume of energy in order to save energy and operate longer. % and last longer. \nSuch positions include carrying heavy weights with extended arms, as shown in Fig. \\ref{exo}. \nAs a result, the available power impose strong limitations on a battery powered exoskeleton \\cite{5979863}. \n\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{The HAL robot suit}\\\\*\nThe current HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) suit, HAL-5, is  a full body exoskeleton that carries its own power supply. It  consists of frames interconnected by power units that each contain an electric motor and reduction gears and are positioned directly next to the hip, knee, shoulder (flexion) and elbow joints of the wearer to assist his movements  \\cite{4108030}. \n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional passive DoF are located at each shoulder, upper  arm, and ankle joint. The suit is powered by batteries. The system is controlled according to the intentions of the wearer, which are obtained by measuring the bioelectric signal (BES) on the skin above the main flexor and extensor \nmuscles associated with each augmented human joint. Motor torques are calculated according to these signals. \n\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{Exoskeleton joints}\\\\*\nThe mechanisms included in exoskeleton joints usually combine slots and rollers mimicking the rolling and sliding of human bones \\cite{5979761}. \nAlso, these exoskeleton joints are limited in strength and in flexibility due to its mechanical configurations and elements \\cite{4058569}.\n\n\nFor exoskeletons with limited power supply, servomotors are efficient by including permanent magnets with the capacity of stepping-down gearing to provide high torque and responsive movement in a small package \\cite{5975494}  \\cite{6491207}. Geared servomotors can also utilize electronic braking to hold in a steady position while consuming minimal power.\nHowever, even with the most efficient servomotor there will be losses of energy. \n%Consequently, the use of a locking mechanism inside the joints will help to maintain the exoskeleton position stiff without using power, increasing the battery life substantially.\n\\\\ \\\\*\n\\textbf{LaMMos mechanism in exoskeleton joints}\\\\*\nSuppose the classic demonstration of exoskeleton, in which the wearer is required to carry heavy weights with extended arms for a long period of time, see Fig. \\ref{exo2}$c$. Or suppose the case of an exoskeleton in the emergency of an earthquake, in which it is holding the roof of a building enabling an exit for people trapped inside. \nIn these case scenarios, the battery of the exoskeleton will drain fast, due to the demanding power by the motors. \n\n  \\begin{figure*} [t]\n      \\centering\n      \\includegraphics[width=0.95 \\textwidth]{fig15.jpg}\n      \\caption{Photos of LaMMos mechanism on DeWaLoP robot. \n      a) The LaMMos linear actuator is pushing the wheeled-leg to lower its position, while the LaMMos bracket is housing the motorized-screw. \n      b) LaMMos mechanism in active mode, fastening the leg to the maintenance unit. \n      c) LaMMos flat-bracket for high payload capacity attaching the $leg$ to the $base$ profile of the wheeled-leg. \n}\n      \\label{3dprocesazzzzasx}\n   \\end{figure*}\n\n\nTherefore, we propose to add to the exoskeleton joints the LaMMos mechanism, in order to lock the position of the limbs dynamically when an increase of power consumption is detected or when required by the user. \nFrom Fig. \\ref{exo2}$b$ and $d$, it is possible to notice that the lower and upper joints mobility are given by the guiding slots. Hence, if the movable plate of the joint integrates a flat-bracket LaMMos for high payload capacity, as shown in Fig. \\ref{exo2}$a$ and $e$. \nThen, the limb can be locked securely in any position and the servomotors from the joints set to standby. And when the task is finished and the exoskeleton is required to move again, the LaMMos are deactivated enabling movement to the exoskeleton as normal. %and the servo motors from the joints activated and able to move as normal. \n\nIn this configuration, the joints by including a LaMMos mechanism for high payload capacity are able to dynamically reconfigure the exoskeleton structure to a static rigid structure at any time, see Fig. \\ref{exo2}$f$. \n\n\n\n\n%Thus, the exoskeleton joints will be able to lock its position dynamically when an increase of power consumption is detected or whenever required, becoming a rigid exoskeleton, saving the batteries energy for more useful tasks.\n\n%Hence, if the LaMMos mechanism is included in this exoskeleton, at a specific position it can become a rigid exoskeleton, saving the batteries for more useful tasks.\n\n%From Fig. \\ref{exo2}, the operator inside the exoskeleton is required to hold several sacks for long periods of time.

This mechanism improves the payload that other common mechanisms provide.\n\n%The LaMMos mechanism implies screw attachment principle of all the fastening elements. In this way, the latching mechanism consists of a bracket with special features, including a motorized-screw. %And a passive T-Slot nut  located on the destination point.\n\nThe LaMMos mechanism requires one motor per each screw, and one actuator per each moving dimension. %For moving in 3D space its requires 3 actuators, for moving in 2D space requires 2 and for one dimension only one actuator.\nHence, the LaMMos mechanism is able to move the robot components in one, two or three dimensional space. And\nattach the components to the robot body or to other robot parts.\n%the other robot parts.%, by firmly tight its bracket with a motorized-screw into a specific part of the robot.%, to a T-Slot nut. \n\nThe LaMMos mechanism can be integrated into any type of bracket, we presented the LaMMos as right-angle bracket and as flat-bracket. Moreover, several LaMMos can be included in a single bracket.\n\nThe presented LaMMos mechanism is useful when the reconfigurable parts of the robot are required to maintain payloads beyond the limit of its movable actuator.\nIt is able to reconstruct a robot, as if a person with a screwdriver tights the screw on the nut. \nIn this way the robot assemble is optimal as the components are latched with each other as if they are constructed.\n\n\n\nFor the LaMMos mechanism evaluation, the DeWaLoP in-pipe robot was used and modified, as shown in Fig. \\ref{3dprocesazzzzasx}. \nInitially a couple of its wheeled-legs were modified to include the right-angle LaMMos bracket instead of rigid brackets. The objective is to lower the wheeled-legs so the in-pipe robot is able to enter its minimal working pipe diameter while protecting it legs. And once inside the pipe reconstruct the robot wheeled-legs as original.\nThe acting forces on the legs of the robot may reach $2000N$ and therefore a latching mechanism with strong stability is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n%Moreover, all wheeled-legs are modified to include a flat-bracket LaMMos mechanism for high payload capacity. The aim of this LaMMos is to add stiffness to the centered structure formed from extending the wheeled-legs once the robot is inside the pipe and ready to rehabilitate the pipe-joint. In this way, the wheeled-legs from been dynamical parts of the robot, become rigid with the structure, by latching each leg to the robot structure. Thus, the robot is able to support forces beyond the payload capacity of its actuators.\n\n\n%Otherwise, with dynamically "soft" re-configurable mechanisms the wheeled-legs may break or permanently damage its joints. \n\n%Thus, this novel mechanism offers many interesting opportunities for robotics research in terms of functionality, payload and size. Since we can reconfigure the robot by constructing it.\n\n\n\n\\addtolength{\\textheight}{-5cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths\n                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens\n                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.\n                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page\n                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make\n                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\\section*{ACKNOWLEDGMENT}\nThis work is part-financed by Project DeWaLoP from the European Regional Development Fund, Cross- Border Cooperation Programme Slovakia- Austria 2007-2013.\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n%\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n%\\end{thebibliography}\n\n\n%\\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}\n\\bibliographystyle{plain}\n%\\bibliography{references}\n% Non-BibTeX users please use\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\n\n\\bibitem{5173816}\n{Ting-li Yang and An-xin Liu and Lu-Zhong Ma and Lu-Bin Hang,\n\tReconfigurable Mechanisms and Robots, 2009.

Previous slab modeling has been extended to cylindrical modeling of radially imploding shocks. The main new effect of the cylindrical geometry is found to be a radial dependence in the speed of shock propagation. This is shown here analytically and in numerical simulations. Ion acceleration by the magnetic shock is shown to possibly become substantial, especially in the peaked structures that develop in the shock because of electron inertia.\n\\footnote{This work was supported by the Naval Research Laboratory Base Program.}\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n%\\pagestyle{myheadings}\n%\\markright{\\hfill \\color{red}\\sf DRAFT VERSION DO NOT CIRCULATE \\hfill}\n\nThere are many interesting phenomena that arise in electron-magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD), which is a model of plasma where the ions are taken to be fixed and electrons are modeled as a fluid.\\cite{Gordeev1994215} One such phenomenon is that the interaction of a current channel with a background-plasma density gradient can drive magnetic shock waves.\\cite{Kingsep_EMHD,Kingsep1983} In a one-dimensional Cartesian reduction, these shock waves are described by Burgers' equation, which has analytical shock solutions with a hyperbolic tangent form. Modifications to this solution are necessary if the width $D$ of the shock front is comparable to the electron inertial length $\\delta_e = c/\\omega_{pe}$.\\cite{kalda:small-scale,Gordeev1994215} Additionally, it was recently shown that electron-inertial effects can, in two dimensions, cause the shock front to go unstable and generate magnetic vortices.\\cite{richardson:2016:EMHD} That work was done in the context of a planar shock wave in Cartesian geometry. In this paper, we demonstrate that the previous results also hold for a cylindrical shock wave, such as might be encountered in the geometry of z-pinch, imploding liner, or plasma-filled diode (PFD) experiments.\\cite{doi:10.1063/1.354711,1347255,kovalchuk_zherlitsyn_pedin_2010} EMHD physics has been hypothesized to be applicable to PFD experiments\\cite{Gordeev1994215}, and future research could compare the instability reported in this paper to experimental results.\nThe main difference between a cylindrical and a planar EMHD magnetic shock is that the planar shock moves at constant speed, while the speed of the cylindrical shock depends on its radial location. In the following sections, this dependence is shown analytically and in numerical simulations, and the implications for possible ion acceleration are discussed. Additionally, we show linear stability calculations and two-dimensional simulation results which demonstrate that electron inertia effects cause the magnetic front to break up into vortices in cylindrical shocks, as was previously shown in planar shocks. More details about these calculations can be found in Ref.~\\onlinecite{richardson:2016:EMHD}, where similar calculations were done in Cartesian geometry.\n\nIn the EMHD model, a fluid approximation is used to describe the electrons while the ions are taken to be fixed. Combining the curl of the electron momentum equation with Maxwell's laws gives a set of dynamical equations for the magnetic field and the vorticity $\\Omg$ of the canonical electron momentum\\cite{Gordeev1994215}:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t {\\pmb \\Omega} &=& \\curl (\\V \\times {\\pmb \\Omega}) - m c \\nu \\curl \\V / e, \\\\\n{\\pmb \\Omega} &=& \\curl (mc\\V/e) - \\B,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\nu$ is the electron-ion collision frequency. The electron fluid velocity $\\V$ is related to the magnetic field through $\\V = -\\frac{c}{4\\pi ne} \\nabla \\times \\B$, because the electrons carry the current, i.e. $\\J = -en\\V$. These equations are simplified by performing the following normalizations: $\\B/B_0\\rightarrow\\B$, $\\Omg/B_0\\rightarrow\\Omg$, ${\\bf x}/\\delta_e\\rightarrow{\\bf x}$, $t \\omega_{ce}\\rightarrow t$, and $n/n_0\\rightarrow n$. With these normalized units, the equations of EMHD are:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t {\\pmb \\Omega} &=& \\curl (\\V \\times {\\pmb \\Omega}) - \\nu \\curl \\V , \\label{eq:vort} \\\\\n{\\pmb \\Omega} &=& \\curl \\V - \\B \\label{vort-def}, \\\\\n\\V &=& -\\frac{1}{n} \\curl \\B.\n\\end{eqnarray}\n In the previous slab geometry, the magnetic field is in the $y$ direction, the background plasma density gradient is in the $z$ direction, and the Hall-driven magnetic shock travels in the $x$ direction. In this paper, the magnetic field is in the $\\theta$ direction, the density gradient is again in the $z$ direction, and the shock propagates in the $r$ direction. We will consider the imploding case, where the shock travels from large radius inward toward the axis. The EMHD equations further simplify when it is assumed that the system is invariant in the direction of the magnetic field.\n\nNote that the cylindrical geometry considered in this paper was also discussed in Section 6 of Ref.~\\onlinecite{Gordeev1994215}. However, in that work, they did not examine radially imploding magnetic shocks, which are the subject of this paper.\n\nAnother simplification used in the previous work, and again assumed to be the case here, is to only consider the scenario where the linear density gradient is small compared to the size $L_z$ of the system in the $z$ direction. In this case, we can write the normalized density as $n = 1+ z/L_n \\simeq 1$ and we have the smallness parameter $L_z\\nabla n = L_z/L_n \\ll 1$. Then $\\Lambda \\equiv \\partial_z \\ln n = L_n^{-1} (1+z/L_n)^{-1} \\simeq L_n^{-1}$. In this approximation, the effect of the density gradient comes through the terms in the EMHD equations that are proportional to $\\Lambda$, which is constant. \n\nWith these simplifications, the EMHD equations become a pair of scalar equations for the magnitudes $B$ and $\\Omega$ of the magnetic field and the vorticity:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Omega &=&  \\partial_r \\frac{1}{r} \\partial_r (r B) + \\partial_z^2 B - { \\Lambda} \\partial_z B - B, \\label{2D-EMHD-1}\\\\\n\\partial_t { \\Omega} &=& \\left\\{ B, \\Omega \\right\\} - \\frac{\\Lambda \\Omega}{r} \\partial_r (rB) -\\nu (\\Omega + B) ,\\label{2D-EMHD-2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere we have used the notation\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\left\\{ B, \\Omega \\right\\} = \\frac{1}{r}\\partial_r(rB) \\partial_z \\Omega - \\partial_r \\Omega \\partial_z B .\n\\end{eqnarray}\nEquations \\eqref{2D-EMHD-1} and \\eqref{2D-EMHD-2} are the subject of this paper. \n\nIn order to better understand the shock-wave solutions to these equations, first consider the case where the solutions are assumed to be invariant in the $z$ direction. The governing equations then only depend on $r$, but are still a relatively complex set of nonlinear equations:\\\\ \\\\\n{\\em 1D cylindrical EMHD shock model}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Omega &=& \\partial_r \\frac{1}{r} \\partial_r (r B)  - B \\label{cyl1}\\\\\n\\partial_t { \\Omega} &=&  -\\frac{\\Lambda \\Omega}{r}\\partial_r(rB)  -\\nu (\\Omega + B) \\label{cyl2}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nOne further simplification is to drop the terms in these equations that arise from the electron inertia, as was done in Ref.~\\onlinecite{richardson:2016:EMHD}. In this case, Eq.~\\eqref{cyl1} becomes $\\Omega = -B$ to lowest order. While it seems that this would allow the last term in Eq.~\\eqref{cyl2} to be dropped, this is not the case if $\\nu$ is large enough. Since we are not making any assumptions about the size of $\\nu$ at this point, that term will be retained.\nThe result is an equation that looks similar to the Burgers' equation that arises in the EMHD slab model, but with some variations because of the differences in the radial derivatives:\\\\ \\\\\n{\\em 1D cylindrical EMHD shock model (neglecting electron inertia)}\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\partial_t { B} &=&  -\\frac{\\Lambda B}{r}\\partial_r(rB)  +\\nu \\partial_r \\frac{1}{r} \\partial_r (r B)  \\label{1D-no-inertia}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWe can estimate the speed of the imploding shock wave by multiplying Eq.~\\eqref{1D-no-inertia} by $r^2$ and integrating over $r$. This gives\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{shock_int1}\n\\partial_t \\int_0^\\infty r^2 B \\, dr &=& -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2} \\left[(rB)^2\\right]_0^\\infty - 2\\nu \\left[rB\\right]_0^\\infty \\\\\n&=& -\\frac{\\Lambda}{2} u_0^2 - 2\\nu u_0. \\notag\n\\end{eqnarray}\nNow consider the case where $rB$ has the form of a shock wave collapsing towards the axis, with $rB=u_0={\\rm constant}$ for $r>r_s(t)$, and $rB=0$ for $r\\leq r_s(t)$, where $r_s(t)$ is the location of the shock front. For this shock wave, the left-hand side of Eq.~\\ref{shock_int1} becomes\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{shock_int2}\n\\partial_t \\int_0^\\infty r^2 B \\, dr = \\partial_t \\int_{r_s(t)}^\\infty r u_0 \\, dr \n= - \\frac{dr_s}{dt} r_s(t) u_0,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the last term comes from applying Leibniz's rule. Combining Eqs.~\\ref{shock_int1} and \\ref{shock_int2} \nimplies that the shock front moves towards the axis with speed $v_{\\rm shock} \\equiv \\vert dr_s/dt\\vert$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nv_{\\rm shock} = \\left\\vert \\frac{1}{2r}(\\Lambda u_0 + 4\\nu) \\right\\vert. \\label{v_shock}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nTo lowest order one would expect that adding back the terms due to electron inertia will not change this shock speed. For the initial condition being considered, with $rB > 0$, this calculation also implies that $\\Lambda < 0$ and $|\\Lambda u_0| > 4\\nu$ is needed in order for the shock to move towards the axis (i.e., $dr_s/dt < 0$).\n\nNotice that the shock speed now explicitly depends on the radius of the shock location. This is in contrast to the EMHD slab model studied previously\\cite{richardson:2016:EMHD}, where the shock speed $v_{\\rm slab}$ is constant, and $v_{\\rm slab} = \\Lambda B_0/2$. This implies that a cylindrical EMHD shock accelerates as it implodes towards the axis, and its speed increases like $1/r$.\n\nIn order to verify this shock speed, a one-dimensional solver was used to solve the 1D EMHD equations both with the inertial terms [Eqs.~\\eqref{cyl1} and \\eqref{cyl2}] and without them [Eq.~\\eqref{1D-no-inertia}]. For these simulations, the parameters were $\\Lambda = -1$, $\\nu = 1$, and $u_0 = 100$, and the initial shape is \\[rB(r) = u_0( 0.5 \\tanh(  (r - 77)/5 ) +0.5 ).\\] Figure \\ref{fig:numerical} shows the numerical solutions. As in slab geometry model, the electron inertia terms cause the shock front to develop a peaked structure, with oscillations behind the front which can be seen by comparing Fig.~\\ref{fig:numerical}(a) and Fig.~\\ref{fig:numerical}(b). Note that because of these peaks, the value of $rB$ can locally become much greater than $u_0$ when the effects of electron inertia are retained. Without the inertial terms, the maximum value that $rB$ attains at any radius is $u_0$. \nAlso, as predicted above, these numerical results show that the shock front accelerates as it approaches the axis.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n(a)\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[]{with_inertial_terms.eps}\n\\end{center}\n(b)\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[]{no_inertial_terms}\n\\caption{Numerical solution to the cylindrical EMHD equations; (a) with electron inertia and (b) without electron inertia. The numbers labeling the curves are the time in normalized units, and the acceleration of the front as it approaches the axis can be clearly seen.\n\\label{fig:numerical}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWith the value of speed given by Eq.~\\eqref{v_shock} we get the following for the analytically predicted shock front location for a shock starting at $r=r_0$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nr_s(t) =  \\sqrt{r_0^2 + (\\Lambda u_0 + 4\\nu) t}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThis is compared in Fig.~\\ref{fig:streak} to a streak image of the numerical solution (with inertial terms) in the $r$,$t$ plane. The dashed curve gives the predicted location of the shock front, where the color contours represent the value of $rB$. The predicted shock location agrees well with the numerical solution.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[]{streak_plot}\n\\caption{Streak plot in $r$, $t$ plane of the numerical solution to the cylindrical EMHD equation with inertial terms. The dashed curve is obtained by integrating the velocity in Eq.~\\eqref{v_shock}. Parameters: $r_0 = 77$, $u_0 = 100$, $\\Lambda = -1$, and $\\nu = 1$.\n\\label{fig:streak}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to estimate how this EMHD shock can accelerate ions, we use a pressure balance argument used by Rosenbluth in his collisionless magnetic piston model\\cite{rosenbluth_pinch}. As the magnetic shock implodes towards the axis, the magnetic pressure in the front is balanced by a kinetic pressure due to the momentum imparted to the ions. The momentum change of the ions in an annular volume $2\\pi r \\Delta r \\Delta z$ is\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta p &=& M (v_f - v_i) = 2\\pi r \\Delta r \\,\\Delta z\\, m n v_f,\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $m$ is the ion mass and $v_f$ is the speed to which the ions are accelerated from $v_i=0$.\nThis momentum change happens during the time in which the shock passes through the region $\\Delta r$, which is related to the speed of the shock: $\\Delta t = \\Delta r/ v_{\\rm shock}(r)$. This gives a  kinetic pressure of\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nP_k &=& \\frac{{\\Delta p}/{\\Delta t}}{2\\pi r \\Delta z} =  m n v_f v_{\\rm shock}(r).\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe final velocity $v_f$ to which the ions are accelerated is found by balancing this kinetic pressure with the magnetic pressure $\\frac{B^2}{8\\pi}$,\nwhich gives a ratio of ion speed to shock speed of \n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\frac{v_f}{v_{\\rm shock}} &=& \\frac{B^2}{8\\pi m n v_{\\rm shock}^2}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nUsing Eq.~\\eqref{v_shock} for the shock velocity, we get\n\\begin{eqnarray}\\label{eq:v_final}\n\\frac{v_f}{v_{\\rm shock}} &=& \\frac{(2rB)^2}{8\\pi m n \\left( {\\Lambda u_0} + 4\\nu \\right)^2}.\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThe numerical solutions for the case without inertia [see Fig.~\\ref{fig:numerical}(b)] show that behind the shock front the solution is approximately given by $rB = u_0 =  {\\rm const}$. For constant $rB$, the velocity ratio in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:v_final} is also approximately constant. If this ratio is much less than one, then the ions don't accelerate much, and this model of ion acceleration is approximately valid.\n\nIn the case where electron inertia effects are retained [Fig.~\\ref{fig:numerical}(a)], the situation is considerably different because of the structure of the shock front. In this case, the shock front develops into a peaked structure, with magnetic fields that can be significantly larger than the previous case of $B\\simeq u_0/r$. As these structures develop, the final ion velocity attained due to magnetic pressure can (locally) increase to large values. This effect is illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{v_final_ions}, where the velocity ratio in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:v_final} is plotted for various times (with ion mass taken to be the proton mass, $m=1$). As is seen in the figure, the ratio becomes substantial and even exceeds unity near time $t=60$. When this happens, the ions are predicted to move faster than the shock front, implying that the ``stationary-ions'' assumption of the EMHD model is clearly not valid. \n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[]{velocity_ratio_new}\n\\caption{Ratio of ion final velocity to the speed of the shock front in the case where electron inertia effects are retained. When this ratio exceeds one, the EMHD model is no longer valid, since ions are accelerated to speeds exceeding the shock front speed.\n\\label{v_final_ions}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nNote that ion acceleration could be a more significant effect in this cylindrical implosion than in the slab model. This is because the development of peaked structures in the shock is due to electron inertia. The effect of electron inertia becomes important when the shock width is comparable to the electron skin depth. However, the shock width is determined by the balance of nonlinear steepening with collisional diffusion, and when the shock moves faster, it is narrower because diffusion has less time to broaden the front. Thus, electron-inertia effects are more important as the shock accelerates towards the axis, and so ion acceleration could also become more pronounced.\n\nAs in the previously studied slab model, there are additional effects that can come into play when variations are allowed in the $z$ direction. In particular, the magnetic shock front can be unstable to a Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) like mode, which will break the shock front apart into vortices that propagate faster than the shock front itself is predicted to move. This effect was examined for the cylindrical model by first doing linear stability calculations of a cylindrical shock front, and then computing solutions to the full 2D equations \\eqref{2D-EMHD-1} and \\eqref{2D-EMHD-2}.\n\nLinear stability calculations for a shock with a profile given by $rB(r) = u_0( 0.5 \\tanh(  r - 77 ) +0.5 )$ show that there exists a range of wave numbers that are unstable. The growth rate $\\gamma$ is the imaginary part of the numerically computed linear eigenvalues, and is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:growth} as a function of wave number $k_z$. For more details about this linear analysis, see Ref.~\\onlinecite{richardson:2016:EMHD}, where the calculation is described in detail for the slab model.\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=7cm]{cylndrical_growth_rates_tanh.pdf}\n\\caption{Growth rate of the fastest growing mode as a function of wavenumber in the $z$ direction.\n\\label{fig:growth}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn order to see the nonlinear structure that develops out of these unstable modes, two dimensional simulations were performed using the BOUT++ framework.\\cite{Dudson2009}  These simulations show that the magnetic front goes unstable to a KH-like mode, just as it does in the slab model. The KH mode develops nonlinearly, breaking apart into a series of magnetic vortices. This can be seen in Fig.~\\ref{2Dsim}. These vortices then travel through the plasma faster than the 1D analysis predicts. This is seen by comparing the 1D simulation to the 2D simulation averaged by integrating over the $z$ direction, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{1D2D}. Also as in the slab case, electron inertia must be retained for this mode to become unstable. Note that the simple pressure-balance derivation for ion motion outlined above will no longer apply once these vortices develop. Very strong magnetic fields become entrained in the vortices, and the possibility of ion motion in the vortices should be considered. In slab geometry, it was shown that the EMHD assumption of quasi-neutrality breaks down\\cite{:/content/aip/journal/pop/21/11/10.1063/1.4902101}, further complicating the physics of these vortices.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Hall_take2}\n\\caption{2D fluid simulation result at time $t=8$, obtained by numerically solving Eqs.~\\ref{cyl1} and \\ref{cyl2}. The magnetic shock front has just gone unstable and broken apart into a series of magnetic vortices at this time.  $\\Lambda = -1$ and $\\nu = 0.0375$.\n\\label{2Dsim}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Hall_take2_comparison2}\n\\caption{Comparison of 1D and 2D numerical solutions at $t=21$, well after the time that the front has broken into vortices. The red curve shows the 1D result, while the black curve is the the 2D result, integrated over the $z$ direction. Note that the vortex in the 2D simulation has moved farther inward than the 1D front. $\\Lambda = -1$ and $\\nu = 0.0375$.\n\\label{1D2D}}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nIn summary, it has been shown that Hall-driven EMHD shocks in cylindrical geometry behave similarly to EMHD shocks in slab geometry. However, rather than moving at constant speed, these shocks accelerate as they implode towards the axis. This accelerating shock steepens, and the nonlinear effects of electron inertia become more important than the smoothing due to collisions. This in turn implies that ion acceleration to large speeds could be possible because of local enhancements to the magnetic field. When this happens, modeling that is more accurate than EMHD becomes necessary for the final stages of the implosion. These effects are further enhanced in 2D by the generation of vortices, which propagate faster than the 1D shock.\n\n\n\n%merlin.mbs aipnum4-1.bst 2010-07-25 4.21a (PWD, AO, DPC) hacked\n%Control: key (0)\n%Control: author (8) initials jnrlst\n%Control: editor formatted (1) identically to author\n%Control: production of article title (-1) disabled\n%Control: page (0) single\n%Control: year (1) truncated\n%Control: production of eprint (0) enabled\n\\begin{thebibliography}{11}%\n\\makeatletter\n\\providecommand \\@ifxundefined [1]{%\n \\@ifx{#1\\undefined}\n}%\n\\providecommand \\@ifnum [1]{%\n \\ifnum #1\\expandafter \\@firstoftwo\n \\else \\expandafter \\@secondoftwo\n \\fi\n}%\n\\providecommand \\@ifx [1]{%\n \\ifx #1\\expandafter \\@firstoftwo\n \\else \\expandafter \\@secondoftwo\n \\fi\n}%\n\\providecommand \\natexlab [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\enquote  [1]{``#1''}%\n\\providecommand \\bibnamefont  [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\bibfnamefont [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\citenamefont [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\href@noop [0]{\\@secondoftwo}%\n\\providecommand \\href [0]{\\begingroup \\@sanitize@url \\@href}%\n\\providecommand \\@href[1]{\\@@startlink{#1}\\@@href}%\n\\providecommand \\@@href[1]{\\endgroup#1\\@@endlink}%\n\\providecommand \\@sanitize@url [0]{\\catcode `\\\\12\\catcode `\\$12\\catcode\n  `\\&12\\catcode `\\#12\\catcode `\\^12\\catcode `\\_12\\catcode `\\%12\\relax}%\n\\providecommand \\@@startlink[1]{}%\n\\providecommand \\@@endlink[0]{}%\n\\providecommand \\url  [0]{\\begingroup\\@sanitize@url \\@url }%\n\\providecommand \\@url [1]{\\endgroup\\@href {#1}{\\urlprefix }}%\n\\providecommand \\urlprefix  [0]{URL }%\n\\providecommand \\Eprint [0]{\\href }%\n\\providecommand \\doibase [0]{http://dx.doi.org/}%\n\\providecommand \\selectlanguage [0]{\\@gobble}%\n\\providecommand \\bibinfo  [0]{\\@secondoftwo}%\n\\providecommand \\bibfield  [0]{\\@secondoftwo}%\n\\providecommand \\translation [1]{[#1]}%\n\\providecommand \\BibitemOpen [0]{}%\n\\providecommand \\bibitemStop [0]{}%\n\\providecommand \\bibitemNoStop [0]{.\\EOS\\space}%\n\\providecommand \\EOS [0]{\\spacefactor3000\\relax}%\n\\providecommand \\BibitemShut  [1]{\\csname bibitem#1\\endcsname}%\n\\let\\auto@bib@innerbib\\@empty\n%</preamble>\n\\bibitem [{\\citenamefont {Gordeev}, \\citenamefont {Kingsep},\\ and\\\n  \\citenamefont {Rudakov}(1994)}]{Gordeev1994215}%\n  \\BibitemOpen\n  \\bibfield  {author} {\\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {A.}~\\bibnamefont\n  {Gordeev}}, \\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {A.}~\\bibnamefont {Kingsep}}, \\\n  and\\ \\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {L.}~\\bibnamefont {Rudakov}},\\ }\\href\n  {\\doibase 10.1016/0370-1573(94)90097-3} {\\bibfield  {journal} {\\bibinfo\n  {journal} {Physics Reports}\\ }\\textbf {\\bibinfo {volume} {243}},\\ \\bibinfo\n  {pages} {215 } (\\bibinfo {year} {1994})}\\BibitemShut {NoStop}%\n\\bibitem [{\\citenamefont {Kingsep}, \\citenamefont {Chukbar},\\ and\\\n  \\citenamefont {Yan'kov}(1990)}]{Kingsep_EMHD}%\n  \\BibitemOpen\n  \\bibfield  {author} {\\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {A.}~\\bibnamefont\n  {Kingsep}}, \\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {K.}~\\bibnamefont {Chukbar}}, \\\n  and\\ \\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {V.}~\\bibnamefont {Yan'kov}}\\\n  }(\\bibinfo  {publisher} {Plenum Publishing Corporation},\\ \\bibinfo {year}\n  {1990})\\ pp.\\ \\bibinfo {pages} {243--291}\\BibitemShut {NoStop}%\n\\bibitem [{\\citenamefont {Kingsep}, \\citenamefont {Mokhov},\\ and\\ \\citenamefont\n  {Chukbar}(1984)}]{Kingsep1983}%\n  \\BibitemOpen\n  \\bibfield  {author} {\\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {A.~S.}\\ \\bibnamefont\n  {Kingsep}}, \\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {Y.~V.}\\ \\bibnamefont {Mokhov}},\n  \\ and\\ \\bibinfo {author} {\\bibfnamefont {K.~V.}\\ \\bibnamefont {Chukbar}},\\\n  }\\href@noop {} {\\bibfield  {journal} {\\bibinfo  {journal} {Sov.

There is no restriction on the initial\ncondition $x_{0}$ that can be any point in the closure of the domain of $A,$\npossibly not a point of definition of $A.$ Equivalently, we also\ncharacterize (strong) Lyapunov functions and, more generally, $a$-Lyapunov\npairs associated to the differential inclusion above. Our criteria are given\nby means only of the data of the system, represented by\\ the multifunction $F\n$ and the operator $A,$ together with first-order approximations of the\ninvariant sets candidates, using Bouligand tangent cones, or, equivalently,\nFr\\\'{e}chet or proximal normal cones, and first-order (general) derivatives\nof Lyapunov functions candidates, using directional derivatives, Fr\\\'{e}chet\nor proximal subdifferentials.\\ \n\nOur analysis aims at gathering in one framework two different kinds of\ndynamic systems that were studied separately in the literature, at least in\nwhat concerns Lyapunov stability. The first kind of these dynamic systems is\ngoverned exclusively by Cusco multifunctions, and gives rise to a natural\nextension of the classical differential equations, given in the form \n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot{x}(t)\\in F(x(t))\\,\\,\\,\\mbox{\\ a.e.\\ }t\\geq 0,\\text{ }x(0)=x_{0}\\in \n\\mathbb{R}^{n}.  \\label{ieq\'.}\n\\end{equation}%\nThe consideration of differential inclusions rather than differential\nequations allows more useful existence theorems, as revealed by\\ Filippov\'s\ntheory for differential equations with discontinuous right-hand-sides \\cite%\n{F}. Stability of such systems; namely, the study of Lyapunov functions and\ninvariant sets, has been extensively studied and investigated especially\nduring the nineties by many authors; see, for example, \\cite{CLSW, CLR, DRW}%\n, as well as \\cite{AF, A, FP} (see, also, the references therein). For\ninstance, complete characterizations for closed sets can be found in \\cite%\n{CLSW} in the finite-dimensional setting, and in \\cite{CLR} for Hilbert\nspaces. It is worth recalling that only the upper semicontinuity of the\nCusco mapping $F$ is required for the weak invariance, while Lipschitzianity\nis used for the strong invariance (see \\cite{CLR}). Invariance\ncharacterizations of a same nature have been done in \\cite{DRW} for\\\none-side Lipschitz (not necessary Lipschitz) and compact-valued\nmultifunctions. These results have been adapted in \\cite{CP2} to the\nfollowing more general differential inclusion (for $T\\in \\lbrack 0,+\\infty ]$%\n)%\n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot{x}(t)\\in F(t,x(t))-\\mathrm{N}_{C(t)}(x(t))\\,\\,\\,\\text{a.e.}\\,\\,t\\in\n\\lbrack 0,T],\\,x(0)=x_{0}\\in C(0),  \\label{ieq\'\'}\n\\end{equation}%\nwhere $C(t)$ is a uniformly prox-regular sets in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $%\n\\mathrm{N}_{C(t)}$ is the associated normal cone. Observe here that the\nright-hand-side may be unbounded, but, however, in the case when $T<+\\infty $%\n, the last differential inclusion above is equivalent to the following one,\nfor some positive constant $M>0,$ \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\dot{x}(t)\\in F(t,x(t))-\\mathrm{N}_{C}(t)(x(t))\\cap \\mathrm{B}(\\theta\n,M)\\,\\,\\,\\text{a.e.}\\,\\,t\\in \\lbrack 0,T],x(0)=x_{0}\\in C(0),\n\\end{equation*}%\ngiving rise to a differential inclusion in the form of (\\ref{ieq\'.}).\n\nThe other kind of systems that is covered by (\\ref{ieq}) concerns\ndifferential inclusions governed by maximal monotone operators, or, more\ngenerally, (single-valued) Lipschitz perturbations of these operators, that\nwe write as \n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot{x}(t)\\in f(x(t))-A(x(t))\\,\\,\\,\\mbox{\\ a.e.\\ }t\\geq 0,\\text{ }%\nx(0)=x_{0}\\in \\overline{\\text{dom}A}.  \\label{mono}\n\\end{equation}%\nThis system can be seen as perturbations of the ordinary differential\nequation $\\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t)),$ where $A$ could represent some associated\ncontrol action. In this single-valued Lipschitzian setting, weak and strong\ninvariance coincide since differential inclusion (\\ref{ieq}) possesses\nunique solutions. Compared to (\\ref{ieq\'.}) the right-hand-side in this\ndifferential inclusion can be unbounded, or even empty. Typical examples of (%\n\\ref{mono}) involve the Fenchel subdifferential of proper, lower\nsemicontinuous convex functions (\\cite{AG}). System (\\ref{mono})\\ has been\nextensively studied; namely, regarding existence, regularity and properties\nof the solutions \\cite{Br}, while\\ Lyapunov stability of such systems have\nbeen initiated in \\cite{P}; see, also, \\cite{AHB2, AHT1, AHT2} for recent\ncontributions on the subject. Different criteria using the semi-group\ngenerated by the operator $A$ can also be found in\\ \\cite{KS}, where\nLyapunov functions are characterized as viscosity-type solutions of\nHamilton-Jacobi equations, and\\ in \\cite{CM}, using implicit tangent cones\nassociated to the invariant sets candidates.\n\nIt is worth observing that (\\ref{ieq}) is a special case of the following\nmore general differential inclusion \n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot{x}(t)\\in F(t,x(t))-A(t)(x(t))\\,\\,\\,\\mbox{\\ a.e.\\ }t\\geq 0,\\text{ }%\nx(0)=x_{0}\\in \\overline{\\text{dom}A(0,\\cdot )},  \\label{ieq\'}\n\\end{equation}%\nwhere $A$ and $F$ are also allowed to move in an appropriate way with\nrespect to the time variable, and satisfying some natural continuity and\nmeasurability conditions. Existence of solution of (\\ref{ieq\'}) have been\nalso studied in \\cite{AS,LM, SY} among others. In particular, in the Hilbert\nspaces setting, \\cite{AS} considered similar systems as the one in (\\ref{ieq}%\n), but with requiring\\ strong assumptions on the multifunction $F.$ In \\cite%\n{SY} the authors assume that $F$ is a single-valued mapping, that is\nLipschitz with respect to the second variable, while the minimal section\nmapping of the maximal monotone operators $A(t)$ is uniformly bounded.\n\nIn this paper, we study and characterize strong and weak invariant closed\nsubsets of the closure of the domain of $A,$ dom$A,$ with respect to\ndifferential inclusion (\\ref{ieq}). We shall assume in our analysis that the\ninvariant sets candidates $S\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ satisfy the following\ncondition \n\\begin{equation}\n\\Pi _{S}(x)\\subset S\\cap \\text{dom$A$}\\,\\,\\,\\forall x\\in \\text{dom$A$},\n\\label{cond.}\n\\end{equation}%\nwhere $\\Pi _{S}$ refers to the projection operator on $S.$ This condition\nhas been used in many works; see, for instance, \\cite{BP}, where the author\nis concerned with flow invariance characterizations for differential\nequations, with right-hand-sides given by nonlinear semigroup generators in\nthe sense of Crandall- Liggett (see \\cite{CL}). It is clear that condition (%\n\\ref{cond.}) holds whenever $S\\subset \\text{dom$A$}$. When dealing with weak\ninvariant closed sets, we shall require some usual\\ boundedness conditions\\\non the invariant set, relying on\\ the minimal norm section of the maximal\nmonotone operator $A.$ \n\nThe paper is organized as follows: After Section 2, reserved to give the\nnecessary notations and present the main tools, we make in Section 3 a\nreview of the existence theorems of differential inclusion (\\ref{ieq}), and\nestablish some first properties of the solutions. In Section 4 we\ncharacterize weak and strong invariant closed sets with respect to (\\ref{ieq}%\n), while in Section 5, criteria for strong Lyapunov pairs are provided. \n\n\\section{Notation and main tools}\n\nIn this paper, the notations $\\langle \\cdot ,\\cdot \\rangle $ and $\\left\\Vert\n\\cdot \\right\\Vert $ are the inner product and the norm in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$,\nrespectively. For each $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\\rho \\geq 0,$ $\\mathrm{B}%\n(x,\\rho )$ is the closed ball with center $x$ and radius $\\rho $; in\nparticular, we denote $\\mathrm{B}_{r}:=\\mathrm{B}(\\theta ,r)$ where $\\theta $\nis the origin vector\\ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Given a nonempty set $S\\subset \n\\mathbb{R}^{n}$, we denote by $\\overline{S}$ and int$(S)$ the closure and\nthe interior of $S,$ respectively. We denote by $\\left\\Vert S\\right\\Vert $\nthe nonnegative real number define by \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\left\\Vert S\\right\\Vert :=\\sup \\{\\left\\Vert v\\right\\Vert :\\,\\,v\\in S\\}.\n\\end{equation*}%\nThe \\textit{orthogonal projection mapping} onto $S$ is defined as \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Pi _{S}(x):=\\{s\\in S:\\,\\,\\left\\Vert x-s\\right\\Vert =d_{S}(x)\\},\n\\end{equation*}%\nwhere $d_{S}(x):=\\inf \\{\\left\\Vert x-s\\right\\Vert ,s\\in S\\}$ is the \\textit{%\ndistance function} to $S$. If $S$ is a closed set, then $\\Pi _{S}(x)\\neq\n\\emptyset $ for every $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We denote by $S^{0}:=\\Pi\n_{S}(\\theta )$ the minimal norm vector in $S$.

In this case,\nfor any $x\\in \\text{dom}A$, $A(x)$ is closed and convex; hence, $%\n(A(x))^{\\circ }$ is singleton.

Suppose that $x(\\cdot )$ is any solution of $(\\ref{ieq})$\nand fix $T>0.$ Since $F$ is Lipschitz and $x(\\cdot )$ is continuous, there\nexists $m>0$ such that $F(x(t))\\subset \\mathrm{B}_{m}$ for all $t\\in \\lbrack\n0,T]$. We define the set-valued mapping $G:[0,T]\\rightrightarrows \\mathbb{R}%\n^{n}$ as \n\\begin{equation*}\nG(t):=[\\dot{x}(t)+A(x(t))]\\cap F(x(t))=\\Big[\\lbrack \\dot{x}(t)+A(x(t))]\\cap \n\\mathrm{B}_{m}\\Big]\\cap F(x(t)).\n\\end{equation*}%\nWe are going to check that $G$ is measurable. Since operator $A$ is maximal\nmonotone, the mappings \n\\begin{equation*}\nx\\mapsto A_{n}(x):=A(x)\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{n},\\text{ }n\\geq 1,\n\\end{equation*}%\nare upper semi-continuous, and so are the mappings \n\\begin{equation*}\nt\\mapsto A_{n}(x(t)):=A(x(t))\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{n},\\text{ }n\\geq 1,\n\\end{equation*}%\ndue to the continuity of the solution $x(\\cdot ).$ Then, due to the relation \n$A(x(t))=\\cup _{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}{A_{n}(}x(t)),$ we deduce that the\nmultifunction $t\\longmapsto A(x(t)\\mathbb{)}$ is measurable. Since $\\dot{x}%\n(t)=\\lim_{n\\rightarrow +\\infty }n(x(t+\\frac{1}{n})-x(t))$ for a.e. $t\\in\n\\lbrack 0,T],$ $\\dot{x}(\\cdot )$ is measurable, we deduce that the\nmultifunction $t\\longmapsto \\lbrack \\dot{x}(t)+A(x(t))]\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{m}$\nis measurable.\\ Similarly, the multifunction $t\\longmapsto F(x(t))$ is\nmeasurable. Consequently, according to \\cite[Proposition III.4]{CV}, the\nmapping $G$ is measurable, and we conclude from \\cite[Theorem III.6]{CV}\nthat $G$ admits a measurable selection; i.e., a measurable function $%\nf:[0,T]\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that \n\\begin{equation*}\nf(t)\\in G(t)=[\\dot{x}(t)+A(x(t))]\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{m}\\cap F(x(t))\\subset\nF(x(t))\\text{ }\\mbox{\\ a.e. \\ }t\\in \\lbrack 0,T].\n\\end{equation*}%\nHence,\\ $\\dot{x}(t)\\in f(t)-A(x(t))$ and $\\left\\Vert f(t)\\right\\Vert \\leq\n\\left\\Vert F(x(t))\\right\\Vert \\leq m$, so that $f\\in L^{\\infty }(0,T;\\mathbb{%\nR}^{n}).$\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\bigskip\n\nThe next theorem shows that differential inclusion $(\\ref{ieq})$ has at\nleast one solution whenever $x_{0}\\in \\overline{\\text{dom}A}$.

Thus, $z(t+%\n\\bar{T};z_{0})=z(t;z(\\bar{T};z_{0}))\\in \\text{epi}\\tilde{V}$ for every $t\\in\n\\lbrack 0,t_{1}]$, and we get a contradiction to the definition of $\\bar{T}$.\n\nFinally, from (\\ref{ee}) we get \\ \n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{at}V(x(t;x_{0}))+\\int_{0}^{t}W_{k}(x(\\tau ;x_{0}))d\\tau \\leq\nV(x_{0})\\,\\,\\forall t\\in \\lbrack 0,T].\n\\end{equation*}%\nMoreover, because $T$ is independent of $k,$ by taking the limit as $%\nk\\rightarrow \\infty $ we arrive at (as $W_{k}(x)\\nearrow W(x)$, by Lemma \\ref%\n{l5.3}) \n\\begin{equation*}\ne^{at}V(x(t;x_{0}))+\\int_{0}^{t}W(x(\\tau ;x_{0}))d\\tau \\leq\nV(x_{0})\\,\\,\\forall t\\in \\lbrack 0,T],\n\\end{equation*}%\nwhich is the desired inequality.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe give now the desired\\ characterization of\\ strong $a$-Lyapunov pairs.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{StrongLyap}Let $V,W,$ and $a$ be as in Proposition $\\ref{t5.3},$ and\nlet $\\partial $ stand for either $\\partial _{P}\\ $or $\\partial _{F}.$ Then\nthe pair\\ $(V,W)$ is a strong $a$-Lyapunov pair for $(\\ref{ieq})$ iff for\nall\\ $x\\in \\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}$ \n\\begin{equation}\n\\underset{\\xi \\in \\partial V(x)}{\\sup }\\,\\,\\underset{v\\in F(x)}{\\sup }\\,\\,%\n\\underset{x^{\\ast }\\in A(x)}{\\inf }\\langle \\xi ,v-x^{\\ast }\\rangle\n+aV(x)+W(x)\\leq 0,  \\label{s1}\n\\end{equation}%\n\\begin{equation}\n\\underset{\\xi \\in \\partial _{P,\\infty }V(x)}{\\sup }\\,\\,\\underset{v\\in F(x)}{%\n\\sup }\\,\\,\\underset{x^{\\ast }\\in A(x)}{\\inf }\\langle \\xi ,v-x^{\\ast }\\rangle\n\\leq 0.  \\label{s2}\n\\end{equation}\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nTo prove\\ the sufficiency part, we take\\ $x_{0}\\in \\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}\n$ and a solution $x(\\cdot ;x_{0})$ of differential inclusion $(\\ref{ieq})$.\nBy\\ Proposition \\ref{t5.3} there exists some $T>0$ such that \n\\begin{equation}\ne^{at}V(x(t;x_{0}))+\\int_{0}^{t}W(x(\\tau ;x_{0}))d\\tau \\leq\nV(x_{0})\\,\\,\\forall t\\in \\lbrack 0,T].  \\label{ie}\n\\end{equation}%\nIt suffices to prove that the following quantity is $+\\infty ,$%\n\\begin{equation*}\nT:=\\sup \\{s\\geq 0:(\\ref{ie})\\text{$\\,$holds$\\,\\forall t\\in \\lbrack 0,s]$}\\}.\n\\end{equation*}%\nOtherwise, if $T$ is finite, then $x(T;x_{0})\\in \\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}$\n(because $V$ is lsc), and again from Proposition \\ref{t5.3} we find $\\eta >0$\nsuch that for all $t\\in \\lbrack 0,\\eta ]$, using\\ the semi-group property of \n$x(\\cdot ;x_{0}),$%\n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n&&e^{a(t+T)}V(x(t+T;x_{0}))+\\int_{0}^{t+T}W(x(\\tau ;x_{0}))d\\tau \\\\\n&\\leq &e^{aT}\\left( e^{at}V(x(t+T;x_{0}))+\\int_{T}^{t+T}W(x(\\tau\n;x_{0}))d\\tau \\right) +\\int_{0}^{T}W(x(\\tau ;x_{0}))d\\tau \\\\\n&\\leq &e^{aT}V(x(T;x_{0}))+\\int_{0}^{T}W(x(\\tau ;x_{0}))d\\tau \\leq V(x_{0}),\n\\end{eqnarray*}%\nand we get the contradiction $T\\geq T+\\eta $. Hence, $T=+\\infty $ and $(\\ref%\n{ie})\\,$holds for all $t\\geq 0,$ showing that $(V,W)$ forms a strong\nLyapunov pair for differential inclusion $(\\ref{ieq}).$\n\nTo prove the necessity of the current conditions, we start by verifying\\ $(%\n\\ref{s1})\\,$with $\\partial =\\partial _{F}$. We\\ fix $x_{0}\\in %\n\\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}$ ($\\subset \\normalfont{\\text{dom$A$}})$ and $v\\in\nF(x_{0}),$\\ and, according to Proposition \\ref{pro3.2}, we choose\\ a\nsolution $x(\\cdot ;x_{0})$ of differential inclusion (\\ref{ieq}) such that\\ $%\n\\frac{d^{+}x(0;x_{0})}{dt}=v-\\Pi _{A(x_{0})}(v).$ Thus, since $(V,W)$ is\nassumed to be a strong $a$-Lyapunov pair for (\\ref{ieq}), we obtain for\nevery $t>0$ \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{V(x(t;x_{0}))-V(x_{0})}{t}+\\frac{e^{at}-1}{t}V(x(t;x_{0}))+\\frac{1}{t}%\n\\int_{0}^{t}W(x(\\tau ;x_{0}))d\\tau \\leq 0,\n\\end{equation*}%\nwhich give us, as $t\\downarrow 0$, \n\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\sigma _{\\partial _{F}V(x_{0})}(v-\\Pi _{A(x_{0})}(v)) &\\leq &V^{\\prime\n}(x_{0};v-\\Pi _{A(x_{0})}(v)) \\\\\n&\\leq &\\underset{t\\downarrow 0}{\\liminf }\\frac{V(x(t;x_{0}))-V(x_{0})}{t}%\n\\leq -aV(x_{0})-W(x_{0}).\n\\end{eqnarray*}%\nHence, $(\\ref{s1})$ follows with either $\\partial =\\partial _{F}$ or $%\n\\partial =\\partial _{P}.$ To verify $(\\ref{s2})$ we fix $x_{0}\\in %\n\\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}},$ $v\\in F(x_{0})$ and $\\xi \\in \\partial\n_{P,\\infty }V(x_{0});$ that is, $(\\xi ,0)\\in \\mathrm{N}_{\\text{epi}%\nV}^{P}(x_{0},V(x_{0})).$ According to Proposition \\ref{pro3.2}, we choose\\ a\nsolution $x(\\cdot ;x_{0})$ of differential inclusion (\\ref{ieq}) such that\\ $%\n\\frac{d^{+}x(0;x_{0})}{dt}=v-\\Pi _{A(x_{0})}(v).$ Since $(V,W)$ is strong $a \n$-Lyapunov for differential inclusion (\\ref{ieq}), one has that $%\n(x(t;x_{0}),e^{-at}V(x_{0}))\\in $epi$V$ for all $t\\geq 0.$ Then, by the\ndefinition of the proximal normal cone, there exists $\\eta >0$ such that for\nall small $t\\geq 0$ \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\langle (\\xi ,0),(x(t;x_{0}),e^{-at}V(x_{0}))-(x_{0},V(x_{0}))\\rangle \\leq\n\\eta \\big(\\left\\Vert x(t;x_{0})-x_{0}\\right\\Vert\n^{2}+|e^{-at}V(x_{0})-V(x_{0})|\\big)^{2},\n\\end{equation*}%\nand so \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\langle \\xi ,x(t;x_{0})-x_{0}\\rangle \\leq \\eta \\big(\\left\\Vert\nx(t;x_{0})-x_{0}\\right\\Vert ^{2}+(e^{-at}-1)^{2}|V(x_{0})|^{2}\\big).\n\\end{equation*}%\nHence, by dividing on\\ $t>0$ and taking limits as $t\\downarrow 0$, we obtain\nthat\\ $\\langle \\xi ,v-\\Pi _{A(x_{0})}(v)\\rangle \\leq 0,$ as we wanted to\nprove.\n\\end{proof}\n\nWe give in the following corollary other criteria for strong $a$-Lyapunov\npairs for $(\\ref{ieq}).$ Recall that $A^{\\circ }$ is said to be locally\nbounded on $\\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}$ if condition (\\ref{mx0}) holds for\nall $x\\in \\text{dom}V;$ that is, for every $x\\in \\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}$\nwe have \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\mathfrak{m}(x)=\\underset{y\\rightarrow x,y\\in \\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}}{%\n\\lim \\sup }\\left\\Vert A^{\\circ }(y)\\right\\Vert <+\\infty .\n\\end{equation*}%\nWe also observe that the function $\\mathfrak{m}$ is upper semicontinuous at\nevery $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $\\mathfrak{m}(x)<+\\infty ;$ that is, \n\\begin{equation}\n\\underset{y\\rightarrow x,y\\in \\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}}{\\lim \\sup }%\n\\mathfrak{m}(y)=\\mathfrak{m}(x).  \\label{uscm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{corollary}\n\\label{c5.3}Let $V,W,$ and $a$ be as in Proposition $\\ref{t5.3},$ and let $%\n\\partial $ stand for either $\\partial _{P},$ $\\partial _{F},$ or $\\partial\n_{L}.$ If $A^{\\circ }$ is locally bounded on $\\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}},$\nthen $(V,W)$ is a strong $a$-Lyapunov pair for $(\\ref{ieq})$ iff one of the\nfollowing statements holds.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item[(i)] For any $x\\in \\normalfont{\\text{dom$V$}}$, \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\underset{\\xi \\in \\partial V(x)}{\\sup }\\,\\,\\underset{v\\in F(x)}{\\sup }\\,\\,%\n\\underset{x^{\\ast }\\in A(x)\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{\\left\\Vert F(x)\\right\\Vert +%\n\\mathfrak{m}(x)}}{\\inf }\\langle \\xi ,v-x^{\\ast }\\rangle

0.\n\\end{equation*}\n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n$(ii)\\Rightarrow (iii).$ This implication follows since that\\ for any $x\\in \n\\text{dom}V$ $(\\subset $dom$A)$ any $v\\in F(x)$\\ \n\\begin{equation*}\n\\Vert \\Pi _{A(x)}(v)\\Vert \\leq \\left\\Vert A^{\\circ }(x)\\right\\Vert\n+\\left\\Vert \\Pi _{A(x)}(v)-A^{\\circ }(x)\\right\\Vert \\leq \\left\\Vert A^{\\circ\n}(x)\\right\\Vert +\\left\\Vert v\\right\\Vert \\leq \\mathfrak{m}(x)+\\left\\Vert\nF(x)\\right\\Vert .\n\\end{equation*}%\n$(iii)\\Rightarrow (i).$ When $\\partial $ stands for either $\\partial _{P}$\nor $\\partial _{F}$ this implication follows from the relation\\ $\\sigma\n_{\\partial _{P}V(x)}(\\cdot )\\leq \\sigma _{\\partial _{F}V(x)}(\\cdot )\\leq\nV^{\\prime }(x;\\cdot )$. If $\\partial =\\partial _{L},$\\ we take $\\xi \\in\n\\partial _{L}V(x)$ and $v\\in F(x),$ and choose\\ sequences $(x_{i})$ and $%\n(\\xi _{i})$ such that \n\\begin{equation*}\nx_{i}\\overset{V}{\\rightarrow }x,\\,\\,\\xi _{i}\\in \\partial\n_{P}V(x_{i}),\\,\\,\\xi _{i}\\rightarrow \\xi \\,\\,\\,\\text{as}\\,\\,i\\rightarrow\n\\infty ;\n\\end{equation*}%\nmoreover, due to the upper semi-continuity of $\\mathfrak{m}$ at $x$ and $%\n\\mathfrak{m}(x)<+\\infty ,$ by assumption, we may\\ assume up to a subsequence\nthat \n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathfrak{m}(x_{i})\\leq \\mathfrak{m}(x)+\\frac{1}{i}\\,\\,\\forall i\\in \\mathbb{N%\n}.  \\label{lb.A}\n\\end{equation}%\nBy the Lipschitzianity of $F$ we also choose a sequence $(v_{i})_{i\\geq 1}$\nsuch that $v_{i}\\in F(x_{i})$ and $v_{i}\\rightarrow v.$ Since $(i)$ holds\nwith $\\partial =\\partial _{P}$, for each $i$ there exists $x_{i}^{\\ast }\\in\nA(x_{i})\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{\\left\\Vert F(x_{i})\\right\\Vert +\\mathfrak{m}%\n(x_{i})} $ such that \n\\begin{equation}\n\\langle \\xi _{i},v_{i}-x_{i}^{\\ast }\\rangle +aV(x_{i})+W(x_{i})\\leq 0.\n\\label{c.5.1a}\n\\end{equation}%\nThen, since the\\ maximal monotone operator $A$ has a closed graph, and $%\n(x_{i}^{\\ast })_{i}$ is bounded, we assume w.l.o.g. that \n\\begin{equation*}\nx_{i}^{\\ast }\\rightarrow x^{\\ast }\\in A(x)\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{\\mathfrak{m}%\n(x)}\\,\\,\\text{as}\\,\\,i\\rightarrow \\infty .\n\\end{equation*}%\nSo, by passing to the limit in\\ (\\ref{c.5.1a}) as $i\\rightarrow \\infty $,\nand using the lower semicontinuity of $W,$ we obtain that \n\\begin{equation}\n\\langle \\xi ,v-x^{\\ast }\\rangle +aV(x)+W(x)\\leq 0,  \\label{c.5.2}\n\\end{equation}%\nwhich shows that $(i)$ holds when $\\partial =\\partial _{L}.$\n\n$(i)\\Rightarrow (V,W)$ is a strong $a$-Lyapunov pair for $(\\ref{ieq}).$\nAccording to Theorem \\ref{StrongLyap} we only need to show that (\\ref{s2})\nholds. We fix $x\\in \\text{dom}V,$ $\\xi \\in \\partial _{P,\\infty }V(x)$ and $%\nv\\in F(x).$ There exist sequences $(x_{i})_{i},$ $(\\xi _{i})_{i},$ and $%\n(\\alpha _{i})_{i}$ such that \n\\begin{equation*}\nx_{i}\\overset{V}{\\rightarrow }x,\\,\\,\\xi _{i}\\in \\partial\n_{P}V(x_{i}),\\,\\,\\alpha _{i}\\downarrow 0,\\,\\,\\alpha _{i}\\xi _{i}\\rightarrow\n\\xi \\ \\text{as}\\,\\,i\\rightarrow \\infty .\n\\end{equation*}%\nBy arguing as in the last paragraph above there also exists a sequence $%\n(v_{i})_{i}$\\ such that $v_{i}\\in F(x_{i})$ and $v_{i}\\rightarrow v\\ $as$\\\ni\\rightarrow \\infty .$ Moreover, using the current assumption on $A^{\\circ\n}, $ there exists $m>0$ such that $\\sup_{i}\\mathfrak{m}(x_{i})\\leq m.$ Now,\nby assumption $(ii),$ for each $i\\in \\mathbb{N}$ there exists a sequences $%\nx_{i}^{\\ast }\\in A(x_{i})\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{\\left\\Vert F(x_{i})\\right\\Vert +%\n\\mathfrak{m}(x_{i})}\\subset A(x_{i})\\cap \\mathrm{B}_{\\left\\Vert\nF(x_{i})\\right\\Vert +m}$ and \n\\begin{equation}\n\\langle \\xi _{i},v_{i}-x_{i}^{\\ast }\\rangle +aV(x_{i})+W(x_{i})\\leq 0.\n\\label{c.1.1}\n\\end{equation}%\nBy using\\ again that $A$ has a closed graph, and that $x_{i}^{\\ast\n}\\rightarrow x^{\\ast }\\in A(x),$ by multiplying the last inequality above\\ (%\n\\ref{c.1.1}) by $\\alpha _{i}$ and next taking limits as $i\\rightarrow \\infty \n$, we arrive at (\\ref{s2}). The proof of the corollary is finished since $%\n(ii)$ is a necessary condition for\\ strong $a$-Lyapunov pairs, as we have\nshown in the proof of Theorem \\ref{StrongLyap}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{} %Please arrange author\'s name in alphabetical order.\n\n\\bibitem{AG} \\textsc{S.

The control problem most commonly addressed in the contemporary literature is to find an optimal policy which maximizes the value function, \\emph{i.e.}, the long run discounted reward of the MDP. The current settings also assume access to a generative model of the MDP with the hidden premise that observations of the system behaviour in the form of sample trajectories can be obtained with ease from the model. In this paper, we consider a modified version, where the cost function is the expectation of a non-convex function of the value function without access to the generative model. Rather, we assume that a sample trajectory generated using a priori chosen behaviour policy is made available. In this restricted setting, we solve the modified control problem in its true sense, \\emph{i.e.}, to find the best possible  policy given this limited information. We propose a stochastic approximation algorithm based on the well-known cross entropy method which is data (sample trajectory) efficient, stable, robust as well as computationally and storage efficient. We provide a proof of convergence of our algorithm to a policy which is globally optimal relative to the behaviour policy. We also present experimental results to corroborate our claims and we demonstrate the superiority of the solution produced by our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms under appropriately chosen behaviour policy.\n\\keywords{Markov Decision Process \\and Off-policy Prediction \\and Control Problem \\and Stochastic Approximation Method \\and Cross Entropy Method \\and Linear Function Approximation \\and ODE Method \\and Global Optimization}\n% \\PACS{PACS code1 \\and PACS code2 \\and more}\n% \\subclass{MSC code1 \\and MSC code2 \\and more}\n\\end{abstract}\n\\section{Summary of Notation}\\label{sec:summary}\n\\vspace*{0mm}\nWe use $\\mathbf{x}$ for random variable and $x$ for deterministic variable. For set $A$,  $I_{A}$ represents the indicator function of $A$, \\emph{i.e.}, $I_{A}(x) = 1$ if $x \\in A$ and $0$ otherwise. Let $f_{\\theta}(\\cdot)$ denote the \\textit{probability density function} parametrized by $\\theta$. Let $\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta}[\\cdot]$ and $P_{\\theta}$ denote the \\textit{expectation} and the induced \\textit{probability measure} \\emph{w.r.t.} $f_{\\theta}$. For $\\rho \\in (0,1)$, let $\\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\theta)$ denote the $(1-\\rho)$-quantile of $J(\\mathbf{x})$ \\emph{w.r.t.} $f_{\\theta}$, \\emph{i.e.},\n\\begin{equation}\n\\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\theta) \\triangleq \\sup\\{l: P_{\\theta}(J(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq l) \\geq \\rho \\}.\n\\end{equation}\nLet $supp(f) \\triangleq \\overline{\\{x | f(x) \\neq 0\\}}$ denote the support of $f$ \\normalsize and $interior(A)$ be the \\textit{interior} of set $A$. Let $\\mathcal{N}_{d}(a, B)$ represent the multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean vector $a$ and covariance matrix $B$. A function $L:\\bbbr^{m} \\rightarrow \\bbbr$ is \\textit{Lipschitz continuous}, if $\\exists K \\geq 0$ \\emph{s.t.} $\\vert L(x) - L(y) \\vert \\leq K\\Vert x - y \\Vert$, $\\forall x, y \\in \\bbbr^{m}$, where $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$ is a norm defined on $\\bbbr^{m}$. Also, for a matrix $A = [a_{ij}]_{1 \\leq i \\leq m, 1 \\leq j \\leq n} \\in \\bbbr^{m \\times n}$, we define the norm $\\Vert A \\Vert_{\\infty} \\triangleq \\max_{1 \\leq i \\leq m} \\sum_{1 \\leq j \\leq n}\\vert a_{ij} \\vert$ and for invertible matrices, we define the \\textit{condition number} $\\kappa(A) \\triangleq \\Vert A \\Vert_{\\infty} \\Vert A^{-1} \\Vert_{\\infty}$. Also, $\\vert A \\vert \\triangleq [\\vert a_{ij} \\vert]_{1 \\leq i \\leq m, 1 \\leq j \\leq n}$. Similarly, for $x \\in \\bbbr^{m}$, the sup norm $\\Vert x \\Vert_{\\infty}$ is defined as $\\Vert x \\Vert_{\\infty} \\triangleq \\sup_{i}{\\vert x_i \\vert}$ and $\\vert x \\vert \\triangleq (\\vert x_i \\vert)_{1 \\leq i \\leq m}$. \n\\section{Introduction and Preliminaries}\\label{sec:intro}\nA discrete time Markov decision process (MDP) \\cite{sutton1998reinforcement,bertsekas1995dynamic} is a 4-tuple ($\\mathbb{S}$, $\\mathbb{A}$, $R$, $P$), where $\\mathbb{S}$ denotes the set of \\textit{states} and $\\mathbb{A}$ is the set of \\textit{actions}. Also, $R: \\mathbb{S} \\times \\mathbb{A} \\times \\mathbb{S} \\rightarrow \\bbbr$ is the \\textit{reward function} where $R(s, a, s^{\'})$ represents the reward obtained in state $s$ after taking action $a$ and transitioning to state $s^{\'}$. Without loss of generality, we assume that the same choice of actions is available for all the states. We also assume that the reward function is bounded, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\Vert R \\Vert_{\\infty} < \\infty$. We let $P:\\mathbb{S} \\times \\mathbb{A} \\times \\mathbb{S} \\rightarrow [0,1]$ denote the \\textit{transition probability kernel}, where $P(s, a, s^{\'})$ is the probability of next state being $s^{\'}$ conditioned on the fact that the current state is $s$ and action taken is $a$. We assume that the state and action spaces are finite. A \\textit{stationary random policy} (SRP) $\\pi(\\cdot \\vert s)$ is a probability distribution over the action space $\\mathbb{A}$ conditioned on state $s \\in \\mathbb{S}$. A given policy $\\pi$ along with the transition kernel $P$ determines the state dynamics of the system. For a given policy $\\pi$, the system behaves as a homogeneous Markov chain with transition probabilities \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:pmstoch}\nP_{\\pi}(s,s^{\'}) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\pi(a \\vert s)P(s, a, s^{\'}), s, s^{\'} \\in \\mathbb{S}.\n\\end{equation}\nIn this paper, we  consider only stationary randomized policies. We also assume that given a SRP $\\pi$, the Markov chain induced  by $P_{\\pi}$ is ergodic, \\emph{i.e.}, the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic.\\vspace*{0mm}\\\\\n\nThe two fundamental questions most commonly addressed in the MDP literature are: $1$. \\textit{Prediction problem} and $2$. \\textit{Control problem}.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Prediction problem: }\nFor a given SRP $\\pi$ and \\textit{discount factor }$\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, the objective is to evaluate the long-run $\\gamma$-discounted cost $V^{\\pi} \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$ which is defined as\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:discost}\nV^{\\pi}(s) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\gamma^{k}R(\\mathbf{s}_{k}, \\mathbf{a}_{k}, \\mathbf{s}_{k+1}) \\Big\\vert s_{0} = s\\right], \\hspace*{3mm} s \\in \\mathbb{S},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the random variable $\\mathbf{s}_{k}$ represents the state at instant $k$, the random variable $\\mathbf{a}_{k}$ represents the action chosen at instant $k$ and the random variable $\\mathbf{s}_{k+1}$ represents the transitioned state after instant $k$, \\emph{i.e.}, the state at instant $k+1$. Further, $\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}[\\cdot]$ is the expectation \\emph{w.r.t.} the probability distribution induced by $P_{\\pi}$ with initial state $\\mathbf{s}_{0} = s$. Note that the cost evaluation in (\\ref{eqn:discost}) is realistic and prudent. Since MDP is a sequential decision making paradigm, the discount factor $\\gamma$ controls the width of the window of future events to be considered to guide the decision process. For $\\gamma$ close to $0$, only the rewards pertaining to the first few transitions count as the effect of the future rewards whose weights are geometric in $\\gamma$ is minimal. However, the case of $\\gamma$ very close to $1$ requires a very long window to be considered. \n\nFor a given policy $\\pi$, the value function $V^{\\pi}$ satisfies the following \\textit{Bellman equation} (written in vector-matrix notation):\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:bellman}\nV^{\\pi} = T^{\\pi}V^{\\pi},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $T^{\\pi}$ called the \\textit{Bellman operator} is defined as $T^{\\pi}V \\triangleq R^{\\pi} + \\gamma P_{\\pi} V$ and $R^{\\pi}(s) \\triangleq \\sum_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\pi(a \\vert s)\\sum_{s^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{S}}P(s, a, s^{\\prime})R(s, a, s^{\\prime})$. Hence $V^{\\pi}$ can be directly computed as $V^{\\pi} = (I-\\gamma P_{\\pi})^{-1}R^{\\pi}$. The computational complexity of the above direct computation is $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{3})$ and the space complexity is $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2})$. An alternate procedure to solve the prediction problem is \\textit{value iteration} that is based on the contraction mapping theorem. It is easy to see that the Bellman operator $T^{\\pi}$ is a contraction mapping with the contraction constant $\\gamma$. Hence by the contraction mapping theorem, $(T^{\\pi})^{k}V \\rightarrow V^{\\pi}$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$, $\\forall V \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$. The computational complexity of this successive approximation procedure is $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2})$ per iteration and the space complexity is $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2})$ as well. The state space $\\mathbb{S}$ can be huge, for example, in cases where the state is represented as a high-dimensional vector. The cardinality of the state space in such a case is exponential in the dimension resulting in a corresponding exponential upsurge in computational effort and storage requirement. In such cases, the above method can become well-nigh intractable. This predicament is referred to in the literature as the \\textit{curse of dimensionality}. One commonly employed heuristic to circumvent the curse is the \\textit{state aggregation} \\cite{bertsekas1989adaptive} technique. However, it also suffers dearly when the state space is huge.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Control problem: } The objective for this problem is to find the optimal stationary policy $\\pi^{*}$ of the MDP, where\n\\begin{equation} \n\\pi^{*}(s) \\in \\argmax_{\\pi}V^{\\pi}(s), \\hspace*{3mm} s \\in \\mathbb{S}.\n\\end{equation}\nThe existence of an optimal stationary policy is proven in \\cite{puterman2014markov}. The optimal value function $V^{*} (= V^{\\pi^{*}})$ satisfies the \\textit{Bellman optimality equation} given by: $T V^{*} = V^{*}$, where the \\textit{Bellman optimality operator} $T$ is defined as $T V(s) \\triangleq max_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}{\\sum_{s^\\prime \\in \\mathbb{S}}P(s, a, s^\\prime)(R(s, a, s^\\prime) + \\gamma V(s^\\prime))}$. The primary numerical methods which solve the control problem are the \\textit{value iteration} and \\textit{policy iteration}. A detailed description of these methods is available in \\cite{puterman2014markov}. In a nutshell, policy iteration can be characterized as generating a sequence of improving policies $\\{\\pi_k\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ with $\\pi_k$ converging to $\\pi^{*}$ after a finite number of steps. Value iteration on the other hand involves repeated application of the Bellman optimality operator, which requires  multiple extensive passes over the state space and the convergence is only guaranteed asymptotically. The computational complexities of policy iteration and value iteration are $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2}\\vert \\mathbb{A} \\vert + \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{3})$ and $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2} \\vert \\mathbb{A} \\vert)$ respectively. The space complexity of both the methods is the same and it is $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert + \\vert \\mathbb{A} \\vert)$. The super-linear dependency of the methods on the size of state space results in the curse of dimensionality. A recently proposed policy iteration method based on stochastic factorization \\cite{barreto2014policy}  has reduced the dependency to linear terms. However, when $\\mathbb{S}$ is very large, stochastic factorization also becomes intractable.\n\\subsection{Model Free Algorithms}\nIn the above section, the  prediction and control algorithms are numerical methods that assume that the probability transition function $P$ and the reward function $R$ are available. In most of the practical scenarios, it is unrealistic to assume that accurate knowledge of $P$ and $R$ is realizable. However, the behaviour of the system can be observed and one needs to either predict the value of a given policy or find the optimal control using the available observations. The observations are in the form of a sample trajectory $\\{s_0, a_0, r_0, s_1, a_1, r_1, s_2, a_2, \\dots \\}$, where $s_i \\in \\mathbb{S}$ is the state and $r_i = R(s_i, a_i, s_{i+1})$ is the immediate reward at time instant $i$. Model free algorithms are basically of three types: (i) Indirect methods, (ii) Direct methods and (iii) Policy search methods. The last of these methods searches in the policy space to find the optimal policy where the performance measure used for comparison is the estimate of the value function induced from the observations. Prominent algorithms in this category are actor-critic \\cite{konda2003onactor}, policy gradient \\cite{baxter2001infinite}, natural actor-critic \\cite{bhatnagar2009natural} and fast policy search \\cite{mannor2003cross}. Indirect methods are based on the certainty equivalence of computing where initially the transition matrix and the expected reward vector are estimated using the observations and subsequently, model based approaches mentioned in the above section are applied on the estimates. A few indirect methods are control learning \\cite{sato1982learning,sato1988learning,kumar1982optimal}, priority sweeping \\cite{moore1993prioritized}, adaptive real-time dynamic programming (ARTDP) \\cite{barto1995learning} and PILCO \\cite{deisenroth2011pilco}. For the case of direct methods which are more appealing, the model is not  estimated, rather the control policy is adapted iteratively using a shadow utility function derived from the  instantiation of the internal dynamics of the MDP. The algorithms in this class are generally referred to in the literature as the \\textit{reinforcement learning} algorithms. Prominent reinforcement learning algorithms include \\textit{temporal difference (TD) learning} \\cite{sutton1988learning} (prediction method), \\textit{Q-learning} \\cite{watkins1989learning} and \\textit{SARSA} \\cite{singh1996reinforcement} (control methods). There are two variants of the prediction algorithm depending on how the sample trajectory is generated. They are \\textit{on-policy} and \\textit{off-policy} algorithms. In the on-policy case, the sample trajectory is generated using the policy $\\pi$ which is being evaluated, \\emph{i.e.},  $s_{i+1} \\sim P(s_i, a_i, \\cdot)$, where $a_i \\sim \\pi(\\cdot \\vert s_{i})$ and $r_i = R(s_i, a_i, s_{i+1})$. In the off-policy case, the sample trajectory is generated using a policy $\\pi_b$ which is possibly different from the policy $\\pi$ that is being evaluated, \\emph{i.e.}, $s_{i+1} \\sim P(s_i, a_i, \\cdot)$, where $a_i \\sim \\pi_b(\\cdot \\vert s_{i})$ and $r_i = R(s_i, a_i, s_{i+1})$. \n\nModel free algorithms are shown to be robust, stable and exhibit good convergence behaviour under realistic assumptions. However, they suffer from the curse of dimensionality which arises due to the space complexity. Note that the space complexity of the above mentioned learning algorithms is $O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert)$, %which is impractical to satisfy when the state space $\\mathbb{S}$ is large.\nwhich becomes unmanageably large with increasing state space.\n\\subsection{Linear Function Approximation (LFA) Methods for Model Free Markov Decision Process}\nTo tackle the curse of dimensionality and to achieve tractability, it is imperative to eliminate the dependency both in terms of the computational and storage requirements of the learning methods on the cardinalities of state and action spaces. An efficient approach is to compactly yet effectively represent the system in a lower $k_1$-dimensional space, where $k_1 \\ll \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert$. A well understood dimensionality reduction technique is the linear function approximation. \nHere, we choose a collection of {\\em prediction features} $\\{\\phi_i\\}_{i=1}^{k_1}$, where $\\phi_i \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$. In this case, the prediction task becomes a projection where\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Pi V^{\\pi} = \\argmin_{h \\in \\bbbh^{\\Phi}} \\Vert V^{\\pi} - h \\Vert^{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\bbbh^{\\Phi} \\triangleq \\{\\Phi x \\vert x \\in \\bbbr^{k_1}\\} \\subset \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$ is the space of representable functions with $\\Phi \\triangleq (\\phi_1, \\dots, \\phi_{k_1}) \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\times k_1}$ and the norm $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$ is chosen appropriately  according to the domain. Note that $\\bbbh^{\\Phi}$ is a linear function space. Further, we define $\\phi(s) \\triangleq (\\phi_1(s), \\dots, \\phi_{k_{1}}(s))^{\\top}$, $s \\in \\mathbb{S}$. Note that $\\phi_i$ can be viewed as a function from $\\mathbb{S}$ to $\\bbbr$. Similarly, the control problem becomes $\\pi^{*}(s) \\in \\argmax_{\\pi}\\Pi V^{\\pi}(s), \\hspace*{1mm} \\forall s \\in \\mathbb{S}$. Note that in the case of large and complex MDPs, the features are not hard-coded, instead one employs compact representations in the form of basis functions. Examples of basis functions include radial basis functions and Fourier basis.\n\nTo address the computational and storage concerns arising due to large action space, a sagacious approach is to employ a parametrized class of SRPs $\\{\\pi_{w} \\vert w \\in \\mathbb{W} \\subset \\bbbr^{k_{2}}\\}$, where $k_{2} \\in \\mathbb{N}$, instead of an exact representation. The most commonly used is the Gibbs (or Boltzmann) ``soft-max" class of policies. In this case, for a given $w \\in \\mathbb{W} \\subset \\bbbr^{k_{2}}$, the SRP $\\pi_{w}$ is defined as\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:stplcy}\n\\pi_{w}(a | s) = \\frac{\\exp{(w^{\\top}\\psi(s, a)/\\tau)}}{\\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\exp{(w^{\\top}\\psi(s,b)/\\tau)}},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\{\\psi(s, a) \\in \\bbbr^{k_{2}} \\vert s \\in \\mathbb{S}, a \\in \\mathbb{A}\\}$ is a given {\\em policy feature set } and $\\tau \\in \\bbbr_{+}$ is fixed \\textit{a priori}.\n\nThe accuracy of the function approximation method depends on the representational/expressive ability of $\\bbbh^{\\Phi}$. For example, when $k_{1} = \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert$, the representational ability is utmost, since $\\bbbh = \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$. In general, $k_1 \\ll n$ and hence $\\bbbh \\subset \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$. So for an arbitrary policy $\\pi$, where $V^{\\pi} \\notin \\bbbh^{\\Phi}$, the prediction of the value function $V^{\\pi}$ shall always incur an unavoidable \\textit{approximation error} ($e_{appr}$) given by $\\inf_{h \\in \\bbbh^{\\Phi}}\\Vert V^{\\pi} - h \\Vert$. Given $\\bbbh^{\\Phi}$, one cannot perform no better than $e_{appr}$. The prediction features $\\{\\phi_i\\}$ are hand-crafted using prior domain knowledge and their choice is critical in approximating the value function. There is an abundance of literature available on the topic. In  this paper, we assume that an appropriately chosen feature set is available \\textit{a priori}. Also note that the convergence of the prediction methods is in asymptotic sense. But in most practical scenarios, the algorithm has to be terminated after a finite number of steps. This incurs an \\textit{estimation error} ($e_{est}$) which however decays to zero, asymptotically.\n\nEven though LFA produces sub-optimal solutions, since the search is conducted on a restricted subspace of $\\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$, it yields large computational and storage benefits. So some degree of trade-off between accuracy and tractability is indeed unavoidable.\n\\subsection{Off-Policy Prediction Using LFA}\\label{subsec:offplcy}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Setup: }Given $w, w_b \\in \\mathbb{W}$ and an observation of the system dynamics in the form of a sample trajectory $\\{s_{0}, a_0, r_{0}, s_{1}, a_1, r_{1}, s_{2}, \\dots \\}$, where at each instant $k$, $a_{k} \\sim \\pi_{w_b}(\\cdot \\vert s_{k})$, $s_{k+1} \\sim $ $P(s_k, a_k, \\cdot)$ and $r_{k}$ = $R(s_{k}, a_{k}, s_{k+1})$, the goal is to estimate the value function $V^{\\pi_{w}}$ of the target policy $\\pi_{w}$ (that is possibly different from $\\pi_{w_b}$). We assume that the Markov chains defined by $P_{w}$ and $P_{w_b}$ are ergodic. Further, let $\\nu_{w}$ and $\\nu_{w_b}$ be the stationary distributions of the Markov chains with transition probability matrices $P_{w}$ and $P_{w_b}$ respectively, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}P_{w}(\\mathbf{s}_k = s) = \\nu_{w}(s)$ and $\\nu_{w}^{\\top}P_{w} = \\nu_{w}^{\\top}$ and likewise for $\\nu_{w_b}$. Note that for brevity the notations have been simplified here, \\emph{i.e.}, $P_{w} \\triangleq P_{\\pi_{w}}$ and $P_{w_b} \\triangleq P_{\\pi_{w_b}}$. We follow the new notation for the rest of the paper. Similarly, $V^{w} \\triangleq V^{\\pi_w}$.\n\nIn the off-policy learning case, the projection is \\emph{w.r.t.} the norm $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}$, where $\\Vert V \\Vert^{2}_{\\nu_{w_b}} = <V, V>_{\\nu_{w_b}}$. The inner product is defined as $<V_1, V_2>_{\\nu} = V_{1}^{\\top}D^{\\nu}V_2$, where $V_1, V_2 \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}, \\nu \\in [0,1]^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$ is a probability mass function over $\\mathbb{S}$ and $D^{\\nu}$ is a $\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\times \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert$ diagonal matrix with $D^{\\nu}_{ii} = \\nu(i)$, $1 \\leq i \\leq \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert$.\nThus the norm $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}$ is in fact the Euclidean norm weighted with the stationary distribution $\\nu_{w_b}$ of the behaviour policy $\\pi_b$, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\Vert V \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}} \\triangleq \\sqrt{\\sum_{s \\in \\mathbb{S}}\\nu_{w_b}(s)V^{2}(s)}$. So\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:hproj}\nh_{w | w_b} \\triangleq \\Pi^{w_b}V^{w} = \\argmin_{h \\in \\bbbh^{\\Phi}} \\Vert V^{w} - h \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}^{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\Pi^{w_b}$ denotes the projection operator \\emph{w.r.t.} $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}$ whose closed form expression can be derived as follows:\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nabla_{x}\\Vert V^{w} - & h \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}^{2} = 0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\nabla_x(V^{w} - \\Phi x)^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}(V^{w} - \\Phi x) = 0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}(V^{w} - \\Phi x) = 0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}\\Phi x  = \\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}V^{w}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow x = (\\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}\\Phi)^{-1}\\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}V^{w} \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\Phi x = \\Phi(\\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}\\Phi)^{-1}\\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}V^{w}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\therefore \\Pi^{w_b} = \\Phi(\\Phi^{\\top} D^{\\nu_{w_b}} \\Phi)^{-1}\\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}.\\hspace*{3cm}\n\\end{equation}\n$\\circledast$ \\textbf{Assumption (A1)} \\textit{The prediction features $\\{\\phi_i\\}_{i=1}^{k_1}$ are linearly independent.}\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Algorithms: }The evaluation of $\\Pi^{w_b}$ requires knowledge of the stationary distribution $\\nu_{w_b}$ which can only be derived if the transition matrix $P_{w_b}$ is available. However, in model free learning $P_{w_b}$ is hidden and hence all the state-of-the-art methods can only derive an approximation to the projection. Two pertinent algorithms are \\textit{off-policy TD($\\lambda$)} and \\textit{off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$)}. The algorithms return a prediction vector $x \\in \\bbbr^{k_{1}}$ \\emph{s.t.} $\\Phi x \\approx h_{w \\vert w_b}$. The major technique used in both the algorithms is to correct the discrepancies between the target and behaviour policies using \\textit{importance sampling} \\cite{glynn1989importance}. Here we introduce the sampling ratio at time $k$ to be $\\rho_{k} \\triangleq \\frac{\\pi_{w}(a_{k} \\vert s_{k})}{\\pi_{w_b}(a_{k} \\vert s_{k})}$, where we use the convention $0/0 = 0$. \\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{Off-policy TD($\\lambda$):} Off-policy TD($\\lambda)$ \\cite{yu2012least,yu2015convergence}, where $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ is one of the fundamental algorithms to approximate value function using linear architecture. The algorithm is defined as follows:\n\\begin{subequations}\\label{eqn:tdalg}\n\\begin{align}\n%\\begin{empheq}[box=\\widefbox]{align}\n&\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{x}_k + \\alpha_{k+1}\\delta_{k+1}(\\mathbf{x}_k)\\mathbf{e}_{k},\\\\\n&\\mathbf{e}_{k+1} := \\gamma\\lambda \\rho_{k} \\mathbf{e}_k + \\phi(s_k), \\hspace*{8mm}\n%\\end{empheq}\n\\end{align}\n\\end{subequations}\nwhere $\\mathbf{e}_{k}, \\mathbf{x}_{k} \\in \\bbbr^{k_{1}}$ and $\\delta_{k+1} \\triangleq \\rho_{k}r_{k} + \\gamma\\rho_{k}\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{\\top}\\phi(s_{k+1}) - \\mathbf{x}_{k}^{\\top}\\phi(s_k)$ is called the \\textit{temporal difference error}. The learning rate $\\alpha_{k}$ is non-negative, deterministic and satisfies $\\sum_{k} \\alpha_k = \\infty$, $\\sum_{k} \\alpha_{k}^{2} < \\infty$. The vector $\\mathbf{e}_{k} \\in \\bbbr^{k_{1}}$  is called the \\textit{eligibility trace} and is used for variance reduction. Eligibility traces accelerate the learning process by integrating temporal differences from multiple time steps. The convergence analysis of the off-policy TD($\\lambda$) method is provided in \\cite{yu2012least}. However, the analysis assumes that the iterates $\\mathbf{x}_{k} \\in \\bar{B}_{r}(0), \\forall k \\geq 0$, with $r > 0$ being sufficiently large. The convergence of the un-constrained case for $\\lambda$ close to $1$ is proved in \\cite{yu2015convergence}.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n$\\bullet$ \\textbf{Off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$):} Off-policy least squares temporal difference (LSTD) with eligibility traces \\cite{yu2012least} is another relevant algorithm in this category. The procedure is described below:\n\\begin{subequations}\\label{eqn:lstd}\n%\\begin{empheq}[box=\\widefbox]{align}\n\\begin{align}\n&\\mathbf{e}_{k+1} := \\gamma\\lambda \\rho_{k} \\mathbf{e}_k + \\phi(s_k), \\hspace*{5mm}\\\\\n&\\mathbf{A}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{A}_{k} + \\frac{1}{k+1}\\left(\\mathbf{e}_{k}(\\phi(s_{k})-\\gamma\\rho_{k}\\phi(s_{k+1}))^{\\top} - \\mathbf{A}_k\\right),\\\\\n&\\mathbf{b}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{b}_{k} + \\frac{1}{k+1}(\\rho_{k}r_{k}\\mathbf{e}_k -   \\mathbf{b}_k), \\hspace*{3mm}\\\\\n&\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{A}^{-1}_{k+1}\\mathbf{b}_{k+1},\\hspace*{3mm}\n\\end{align}\n%\\end{empheq}\n\\end{subequations}\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}_{k} \\in \\bbbr^{k_{1} \\times k_{1}}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_{k}$, $\\mathbf{b}_{k}$, $\\mathbf{x}_{k} \\in \\bbbr^{k_{1}}$. In some cases, the matrix $\\mathbf{A}_{k}$ may not be of full rank. To avoid such singularities, initialize $\\mathbf{A}_0$ with $\\delta \\bbbone_{k_1 \\times k_1}$, $\\delta > 0$.\n\nContrary to the earlier algorithm, the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) is shown to be stable with well defined limiting behaviour for all $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ under pragmatic assumptions. The only restriction imposed is that the target policy $\\pi_{w}$ is \\emph{absolutely continuous} ($\\prec$) \\emph{w.r.t.} the behaviour policy $\\pi_b$, \\emph{i.e.}, \n\\begin{equation}\n\\pi_{w} \\prec \\pi_{w_b} \\hspace*{5mm}\\Leftrightarrow \\hspace*{5mm}\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\pi_{w}(a \\vert s) = 0, \\hspace*{2mm}\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{A}, \\forall s \\in \\mathbb{S}.\n\\end{equation}\nThe contrapositive form of the above statement implies that $\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s) \\neq 0 \\Rightarrow \\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s) \\neq 0$, $\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{A}, \\forall s \\in \\mathbb{S}$. This means that for a given state $s \\in \\mathbb{S}$, every action feasible under the target policy $\\pi_{w}$ is also feasible under the behaviour policy $\\pi_{w_b}$. The following result from \\cite{yu2012least} characterizes the limiting behaviour of the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) algorithm:\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:offplcy}\nFor a given target policy vector $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$ and a behaviour policy vector $w_b \\in \\mathbb{W}$, the sequence $\\{\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\}$ generated by the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) algorithm defined in Equation (\\ref{eqn:lstd}) converges to the limit $x_{w \\vert w_b}$ with probability one, where\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:offls}\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{w | w_b} = A^{-1}_{w \\vert w_b} & b_{w \\vert w_b}, \\hspace*{3mm} \\textrm{with} \\hspace*{45mm}\\\\ \nA_{w \\vert w_b} &= \\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}(I-\\gamma \\lambda P_{w})^{-1}(I-\\gamma P_{w})\\Phi \\hspace*{5mm}\\textrm{ and }\\\\ b_{w \\vert w_b} &= \\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w_b}}(I-\\gamma\\lambda P_{w})^{-1}R^{w}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nHere $D^{\\nu_{w_b}}$ is the diagonal matrix with $D^{\\nu_{w_b}}_{ii}=\\nu_{w_b}(i)$, $1 \\leq i \\leq \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert$, where $\\nu_{w_b}$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov chain $P_{w_b}$ induced by the behaviour policy $\\pi_{w_b}$, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\nu_{w_b}$ satisfies $\\nu_{w_b}^{\\top} P_{w_b} = \\nu_{w_b}^{\\top}$ and $R^{w}(s) \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$ is the expected reward, \\emph{i.e.}, $R^{w} \\triangleq \\Sigma_{s^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{S}, a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s)P(s, a, s^{\\prime})R(s, a, s^{\\prime})$.\n\\end{theorem}\nIt is also important to note that in the on-policy LSTD($\\lambda$), where both $\\pi_w$ and $\\pi_{w_b}$ are the same, the limit point $x_{w | w}$ is given by $x_{w \\vert w} = A_{w \\vert w}^{-1}b_{w \\vert w}$, where\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:onls}\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{w \\vert w} &= \\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w}}(I-\\gamma \\lambda P_{w})^{-1}(I-\\gamma P_{w})\\Phi \\hspace*{2mm} \\textrm{ and }\\\\  b_{w \\vert w} &= \\Phi^{\\top}D^{\\nu_{w}}(I-\\gamma\\lambda P_{w})^{-1}R^{w}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{The Control Problem of Interest}\\label{sec:sec1}\nIn this section, we define a variant of the control problem which is the topic of interest in this paper.\\\\\\\\\n\\textbf{Problem Statement: } \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:modctrl}\n\\textrm{ Find } w^{*} \\in \\argmax_{w \\in \\mathbb{W} \\subset \\bbbr^{k_{2}}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w}}\\left[L(h_{w \\vert w})\\right],\n\\end{equation}\\\\\nwhere  $L:\\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert} \\rightarrow \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$ is a performance function.  We assume that $L$ is bounded and continuous. Note that since $h_{w \\vert w} \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$, we have $L(h_{w \\vert w}) \\in \\bbbr^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}$, \\emph{i.e.}, $L(h_{w \\vert w})$ can be viewed as a mapping from the the state space $\\mathbb{S}$ to the scalars. In the case of finite MDP (both $\\mathbb{S}$ and $\\mathbb{A}$ are finite),  we have $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w}}\\left[L(h_{w \\vert w})\\right] = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathbb{S}}\\nu_{w}(s)L(h_{w \\vert w})(s)$. Thus the objective function in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}) is scalar-valued and hence the optimization problem defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}) is indeed well-defined.\\\\\n\n\n\\noindent\n$\\circledast$ \\textbf{Assumption (A2)} \\textit{The Markov chain under any SRP $\\pi_{w}, w \\in \\bbbr^{k_2}$ is ergodic, \\emph{i.e.}, irreducible and aperiodic.}\\vspace*{4mm}\\\\\n$\\circledast$ \\textbf{Assumption (A3)} \\textit{$\\mathbb{W}$ is a compact subset of $\\bbbr^{k_{2}}$.}\n\\subsection{Motivation}\n%\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\\textwidth}\n%  \\begin{center}\n%    \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{exctrl}\n%  \\end{center}\n%  \\caption{A gull}\n%\\end{wrapfigure}\n%\\textbf{Example 1: } $k_1 = 3$, $k_2 = 1$, $\\mathbb{S} = \\{1,2,3\\}$, $\\mathbb{A} = \\{1, 2\\}$, $\\gamma = 0.8$, %$\\lambda = 0.00125$, $\\tau = 10$, $\\psi(s, a) = s*a$, $\\Phi = (1, 0, 1)^{\\top}$, $D^{\\nu_b} = (1/3)\\bbbone_{3 %\\times 3}$, $L(x) = \\sin{(10\\pi x)}$, $P(1,1,2)=P(3,1,1)=1/5, P(1,2,2)=P(3,2,1)=1/3, P(1,1,3)=P(3,1,2)=4/5, %P(1,2,3)=P(3,2,2)=2/3,P(2,1,1)=3/5, P(2,2,1)=1/4, P(2,1,3)=2/5 ,P(2,2,3)=3/4$. The plot of $\\Vert L(h_{\\pi_{w}}) %\\Vert^{2}_{\\nu_{b}}$ is shown in Fig \\ref{fig:exctrl}.\nWe demonstrate here a practical situation where the optimization problem of the kind (\\ref{eq:modctrl}) arises. We consider here a special case of the self-drive system. The goal is to propel an automotive (equipped with sensors to detect the vehicular traffic) from source $0$ to destination $F$ (where there are multiple intersections in between) in minimum time without any accidents. Here, the collection of junctions represents the state space, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\mathbb{S} = \\{0,1,2,3,F\\}$. The automotive travels with a constant velocity between subsequent intersections and the choice of the velocities is restricted to the discrete, finite set $\\{1,2,3\\}$. The velocity is chosen randomly by the automotive from the above set at each intersection. The purpose of the randomness is to capture the uncertainty in the traffic conditions during the subsequent stretch of the trip. \nAt each intersection, the automotive senses the vehicular traffic at the intersection and has to make a choice of whether to halt or not. \n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.45\\textwidth}\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=50mm, height=30mm]{carex}\n\t\\end{subfigure}\n\t\\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.5\\textwidth}\n\t\t%\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=60mm, height=14mm]{carexmdp}\n\t\t%\t\t\\subcaption{MDP of the self-drive system }\n\t\\end{subfigure}\n\t\\caption{Self-drive system}\t\n\\end{figure}    \nSo the action space is $\\mathbb{A} = \\{0 \\textrm{ (halt)}, 1 \\textrm{ (proceed)}\\}$. Here, the performance of the task is evaluated based on the overall time the automotive takes to cover the distance to the destination. Hence the reward function is taken as the velocity chosen by the automotive to traverse the subsequent stretch. This indeed makes sense since the time is directly dependent on the velocity with distance being constant.  This optimization problem can be modeled using a finite horizon cost function. Now, suppose that the task is further rewarded based on the overall time it takes to complete the trip. In this case, the final payoff is dependent on the value function (in this case, the value function is time), then the role of the performance function $L$ is to capture this particular aspect. If the payoffs are  further based on the maintenance cost incurred (which cannot be integrated into the reward function due to the presence of multiple operating components and hence considering the net maintenance cost at the end of the episode is more worthwhile), the performance function might not be unimodal in general. This is further confirmed by Fig. \\ref{fig:exctrl}, where we provide the plot of the objective function of the self-drive MDP which exhibits a complex landscape with many local optima.\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=75mm, height=50mm]{carexobj-crop}\n\t\\caption{$\\mathbb{S} = \\{0,1,2,F\\}$, $\\mathbb{A} = \\{0,1\\}$, $k_1=1$, $k_2=1$, $\\gamma = 0.99, \\tau = 10$, $\\lambda = 0.00125$, $\\psi(s, a)=s*a, \\Phi=(1, 0, 1, 0)^{\\top}$, $L(h_{w \\vert w})(s) = \\sin^{2}{(\\frac{\\pi}{2} s)}$, $P(0,0,0)=P(1,0,1)=P(2,0,2)=1.0$, $P(0,1,1)=P(1,1,2)=P(2,1,F)=1.0$. The remaining transition probabilities are zero. }\\label{fig:exctrl}\n\\end{figure}\nThis particular problem is more relevant in the context of neural computation, where distinct neural substrates in regions of prefrontal and anterior striatum have been identified with human habitual learning (model free reinforcement learning) \\cite{o2015structure,balleine1998goal,lee2014neural}. The human brain is a complex network of computing components and one is inclined to believe that the value function obtained through the habitual learning  will be further evaluated using a performance function (similar to the activation function found in the artificial neural networks) before relaying to the subsequent level in the network.\n%\\end{SCfigure}\n%\\begin{empheq}[box=\\widefboxy]{align}\n\nThe control problem in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}) is harder due to the application of the  performance function $L$ on the approximate value function. Hence we cannot apply the existing direct model free methods like LSPI or off-policy Q-learning \\cite{maei2010toward}. Note that the LSPI algorithm (Fig. $8$ of \\cite{lagoudakis2003least}) is a policy iteration method, where at each iteration an improved policy parameter is deduced from the projected Q-value of the previous policy parameter. So one cannot directly incorporate the operator $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_w}$ into the LSPI iteration. Similar compatibility issues are found with the off-policy Q-learning also \\cite{maei2010toward}. However, policy search methods are a direct match for this problem. Not all policy search methods can provide quality solutions. The pertinent issue is the non-convexity of $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_w}\\left[L(h_{w \\vert w})\\right]$ which presents a landscape with many local optima. Any gradient based method like the state-of-the-art simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) \\cite{spall1992multivariate} algorithm or the policy gradient methods can only provide sub-optimal solutions.  In this paper, we try to solve the control problem in its \\emph{true sense}, \\emph{i.e.}, find a solution close to the global optimum of the optimization problem (\\ref{eq:modctrl}). We employ a stochastic approximation variant of the well known cross entropy (CE) method proposed in \\cite{predictsce2016,genstochce2016,ajincedet} to achieve the \\emph{true sense} behaviour. The CE method has in fact been applied to the model free control setting before in \\cite{mannor2003cross}, where the algorithm is termed the \\textit{fast policy search}. However, the approach in \\cite{mannor2003cross} has left several practical and computational challenges uncovered. The method in \\cite{mannor2003cross} assumes access to a generative model, \\emph{i.e.}, the real MDP system itself or a simulator/computational model of the MDP under consideration, which can be configured with moderate ease (with time constraints) and the observations recorded. The existence of generative models for extremely complex MDPs is highly unlikely, since it demands accurate knowledge about the transition dynamics of the MDP. Now regarding the computational aspect, the algorithm in \\cite{mannor2003cross} maintains an evolving $\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\times \\vert \\mathbb{A} \\vert$ matrix $P^{(t)} \\triangleq (P^{(t)}_{sa})_{s \\in \\mathbb{S}, a \\in \\mathbb{A}}$, where $P^{(t)}_{sa}$ is the probability of taking action $a$ in state $s$ at time $t$. At each discrete time instant $t$, the algorithm generates multiple sample trajectories using $P^{(t)}$, each of finite length, but sufficiently long. For each trajectory, the discounted cost is calculated and then averaged over those multiple trajectories to deduce the subsequent iterate $P^{(t+1)}$. This however is an expensive operation, both computation and storage wise. Another pertinent issue is the number of sample trajectories required at each time instant $t$. There is no analysis pertaining to finding a bound on the trajectory count. This implies a brute-force approach has to be adopted and this further burdens the algorithm. A more recent global optimization algorithm called the model reference adaptive search (MRAS) has also been applied in the model free control setting \\cite{chang2013simulation}. However, it also suffers from similar issues as the earlier approach.\\\\\n\nHere, we illustrate using a real life scenario, the hardness incurred in assuming a generative model. We consider a legacy water delivery system \\cite{feinberg2012handbook,fracasso2014optimized,ikonen2011scheduling,ertin2001dynamic}.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\centering\t\n\t\\fbox{\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\textwidth, height=40mm]{damexample2}}\n\t\\caption{Water delivery network: The system consists of a water reservoir and a web of manual controllers.

The reservoir operators have to rely on agreed upon rules, their judgement and experience to calibrate the network. Fig.\\ref{fig:waterdelv} shows a water delivery network where there is a web of manual controllers. The state space is the net output (quantity of water delivered) of the delivery system. Intuitively, one might expect the dynamics of the system to be Markovian in character since the immediate future output is indeed dependent on the current quantity of the reservoir and its current consumption rate. So the state variable takes real values and the underlying MDP is continuous.\nThe reward function is a complex function with positive weights on profits from  effective utilization (agriculture, drinking purpose, power generation, \\emph{etc}) and negative weights on spill overs, kinetic energy losses and factors engendering physical damage to the network like excessive pipe pressure.  The objective is to find a configuration for the network of controllers (which is indeed a vector with each co-ordinate deciding the amount of calibration required for the corresponding controller) which provides optimum expected discounted reward. Here the configurations represent the action space and thus are also continuous. The reconfiguration of the whole system as and when  demanded by the algorithm requires heavy human labor, which is a luxury one cannot afford. On the other hand, developing a simulator for this system requires understanding all the sources of water for the reservoir which depends on a wide variety of environmental factors and also the consumption statistics of the end users, both of which require observations for a long period of time notwithstanding the human labor incurred. Therefore, it is hard in general to develop a simulator/generative model for MDPs with large state  and action spaces with complex, opaque and perplexing transition dynamics. Examples where similar issues arise can be found in manual human control, social sciences, biological systems, unmanned aerial vehicles \\cite{bagnell2001autonomous} and mechanical systems which wear out quickly like low-cost robots \\cite{deisenroth2011pilco}.\\\\\n\nOther relevant work in the literature includes Bellman-residual minimization based fitted policy iteration using a single trajectory \\cite{antos2008learning} and value-iteration based fitted policy iteration using a single trajectory \\cite{antos2007value}. However, those approaches fall prey to the curse of dimensionality arising from large action spaces.  Also, they are abstract in the sense that a generic function space is considered and the value function approximation step is expressed as a formal optimization problem. In the above methods which are almost similar in their approach, considerable effort is dedicated to addressing the approximation power of the function space and sample complexity.\n\nIn this paper, we address the above mentioned practical and computational concerns. We focus on two key objectives: \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\t\\item \n\tTo reduce the total number of policy evaluations.\n\t\\item\n\tTo find a high performing policy without presuming an unlimited access to the generative model.\n\\end{enumerate}\nBy accomplishing the above mentioned objectives, we try to chisel down the requirements inherent in most of the reinforcement learning algorithms and thus enable them to operate in real-time scenarios. We provide here a brief narrative of the approach we follow to realize the above objectives.\n\nTo accomplish the former objective, the ubiquitous choice is to employ the stochastic approximation (SA) version of the CE method instead of the naive CE method used in \\cite{mannor2003cross}. The SA version of CE is a zero-order optimization method which is incremental, adaptive, robust and stable with the additional attractive attribute of convergence to the global optimum of the objective function. It has been demonstrated empirically in \\cite{predictsce2016,ajincedet} that the method exhibits efficient utilization of the samples and possesses better rate of convergence than the naive CE method. The effective sample utilization implies that the method requires minimum number of objective function evaluations. These attributes are appealing in the context of the control problem we consider here, especially in effectively addressing the former objective.  The adaptive nature of the algorithm apparently eliminates any brute-force approach which has a detrimental impact on the performance of the naive CE method. \n\n\n\nThe latter objective is achieved by employing the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) for policy evaluation which is defined in Section 2.3. The advantage of this method lies in its ability to approximate the value function of an arbitrary policy (called the target policy) using the observations of the MDP under a possibly different policy (called the behaviour policy), with the only restriction being the absolute continuity between the target and behaviour policies. This implies that we optimize the approximate objective function given by \n$\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(\\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b})\\right]$ (where $x_{w \\vert w_b}$ is the solution generated by the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$)) instead of the true objective function $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_w}\\left[L(h_{w \\vert w})\\right]$. Here, $\\nu_{w_b}$ is\nthe steady state distribution of the Markov chain induced by the behaviour policy $\\pi_{w_b}$. This is the best approximation possible under the absence of the generative model since $\\nu_{w}$ is the long-run steady state marginal distribution of the Markov chain induced by the policy $\\pi_{w}$ and one cannot correct the long-run discrepancies arising due to the restriction that the available sample trajectory is generated using the behaviour policy. However, hidden deep under the appealing characteristic of the single sample trajectory approach is the painful Achilles’ heel of choice, where one cannot forget that the quality of the solution contrived by the algorithm depends on the choice of the sample trajectory which is directly dependent on the behaviour policy that generates it. The additional approximation error incurred due to this particular information restrictive setting is indeed unavoidable. In order to choose the behaviour policy wisely, it is imperative to provide a quantitative analysis of the cost incurred in the choice of the behaviour policy. In this paper, we provide a bound on the approximation error of the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) solution of an arbitrary target policy with respect to the deviation of the target policy from the behaviour policy. The practical aspect of the approach can be further improved by reconsidering the same sample trajectory for all value function evaluations. This implies that our algorithm just requires a single sample trajectory to solve the optimization problem defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}). Since the access to the generative model is forbidden, in order to reuse the trajectory, one has to find provisions in terms of memory to store the transition stream.\\vspace*{3mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Goal of the Paper: }\n\\textit{To solve the control problem defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}) without having access to any generative model.

We graphically illustrate this classification as a pyramid in Fig. \\ref{fig:contentpyramid}. The bottom of the pyramid contains the classical methods, where the entire model information, \\emph{i.e.}, both $P$ and $R$ are available, while in the middle, we have the  model free algorithms, where both $P$ and $R$ are assumed hidden, however an access to the generative model/simulator is presumed. In the top of the pyramid, we have the single trajectory approaches, where a single sample trajectory generated using a behaviour policy is made available,  however, the algorithms have no access to the model information or simulator. Observe that as one goes up the pyramid, the mass of the information vested upon the algorithm reduces considerably. The algorithm we propose in this paper belongs to the top of the information pyramid and to the upper half of the optimization box which makes it a unique combination.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{infocontent}\n\t\\caption{(a) Information pyramid\\hspace*{25mm}(b) Optimization box}\\label{fig:contentpyramid}\n\\end{figure}\n\\section{Proposed Algorithm}\nIn this section, we propose an algorithm to solve the control problem defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}). We employ a stochastic approximation variant of the Gaussian based cross entropy method to find the optimal policy. We delay the discussion of the algorithm until the next subsection. We now focus on the objective function estimation. The objective function values $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w}}\\left[L(h_{w \\vert w})\\right]$ which are required to efficiently guide the search for $w^{*}$ are estimated using the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) method. In LFA, given $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, the best approximation of $V^{w}$ one can hope for is the projection $\\Pi^{w}V^{w}$. Theorem $1$ of \\cite{tsitsiklis1997analysis} shows that the on-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) solution $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w}$ is indeed an approximation of the projection $\\Pi^{w}V^{w}$. Using Babylonian-Pythagorean theorem and Theorem $1$ of \\cite{tsitsiklis1997analysis} along with a little arithmetic, we obtain $\\Vert \\Phi x_{w \\vert w} - \\Pi^{w}V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w}} \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{(1-\\lambda)\\gamma(\\gamma+\\gamma\\lambda+2)}}{1-\\gamma}\\Vert\\Pi^{w}V^{w} - V^{w}\\Vert_{\\nu_{w}}$. Hence for $\\lambda = 1$, we have $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w} = \\Pi^{w}V^{w}$, \\emph{i.e.}, the on-policy LSTD(1) provides the exact projection. However for $\\lambda < 1$, only approximations to it are obtained. Now when off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) is applied, it adds one more level of approximation, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w}$ is approximated by $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b}$. Hence to evaluate the performance of the off-policy approximation, we must quantify the errors incurred in the approximation procedure and we believe a  capacious analysis had been far overdue.\n\\subsection{Choice of the behaviour policy}\nThe behaviour policy is often an exploration policy which promotes the exploration of the state and action spaces of the MDP. Efficient exploration is a precondition for effective learning. In this paper, we operate in a minimalistic MDP setting, where the only information available for inference is the single stream of transitions and payoffs generated using the behaviour policy. So the choice of the behaviour policy is vital for a sound inductive reasoning.  The following theorem will provide a bound on the approximation error incurred in the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) method. The provided bound can be beneficial in choosing a good behaviour policy and also supplements in understanding the stability and usefulness of the proposed algorithm.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:solbd}\nFor a given $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, the target policy vector, and $w_b \\in \\mathbb{W}$, the behaviour policy vector, let $x_{w \\vert w}$ and $x_{w \\vert w_b}$ be the solutions of the on-policy and off-policy versions of LSTD($\\lambda$), respectively, with $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$.\n\\begin{flalign}\n\\textit{If }\\hspace*{1mm}\\sup_{s \\in \\mathbb{S}, a \\in \\mathbb{A}}&\\Big\\vert \\frac{\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s)}{\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)}-1\\Big\\vert < \\epsilon_2, \\textrm{ then } \\frac{\\big\\Vert x_{w \\vert w} - x_{w \\vert w_b} \\big\\Vert_{\\infty}}{\\Vert x_{w \\vert w}\\Vert_{\\infty}} \\leq \\nonumber\\\\&O\\big((\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2}\\epsilon^{2}_2 + \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\epsilon_2)\\frac{(1+\\gamma)(1+\\gamma\\lambda)}{(1-\\gamma)(1-\\gamma\\lambda)}\\Vert D^{\\nu_{w_b}}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert(D^{\\nu_{w_b}})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\big).\\label{eqn:thmbd1}\n\\end{flalign}\n\\begin{flalign}\n\\textit{Also, }\\hspace*{1mm}&\\Vert \\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}} \\leq \n\\frac{\\gamma-2\\gamma\\lambda+1}{1-\\gamma}\\Vert V^{w} - V^{w_b} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}} + \\hspace*{10mm}\\nonumber\\\\&\\hspace*{20mm}\\frac{\\epsilon_2(1-\\gamma\\lambda)\\Vert R \\Vert_{\\infty}}{(1-\\gamma)^{2}} + \\frac{1-\\gamma\\lambda}{1-\\gamma}\\Vert \\Pi^{w_b}V^{w} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}},\\label{eqn:thmbd2}\n\\end{flalign}\nwhere $V^{w}$ and $V^{w_b}$ are the true value functions corresponding to the SRPs $\\pi_w$ and $\\pi_{w_b}$ respectively. Also, $\\nu_{w_b}$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov chain defined by $P_{w_b}$ and $D^{\\nu_{w_b}}$ is the diagonal matrix defined in Theorem \\ref{thm:offplcy}.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\begin{Proof}\nGiven $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, we have \\\\\n\\begin{gather*}\nP_{w}(s, s^{\\prime}) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s)P(s, a, s^{\'}), s, s^{\'} \\in \\mathbb{S},\\\\\nP_{w_b}(s, s^{\\prime}) = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)P(s, a, s^{\'}), s, s^{\'} \\in \\mathbb{S}.\n\\end{gather*}\nTherefore,\n\\begin{gather*}\nP_{w} = P_{w_b} + F, \\hspace*{4mm} \\textrm{where} \\hspace*{2mm} F = P_{w} - P_{w_b}.\n\\end{gather*}\nHence, for $s, s^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{S}$,\n%\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:fbddrv}\n\\vert F(s, s^{\\prime}) \\vert &= \\Big\\vert \\sum_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\left(\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s) - \\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)\\right)P(s, a, s^{\\prime}) \\Big\\vert,\\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\Big\\vert \\sum_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s)}{\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)} - 1\\right)\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)P(s, a, s^{\\prime}) \\Big\\vert,\\nonumber\\\\\n&\\leq \\sum_{a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\epsilon_2\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)P(s, a, s^{\\prime}),\\nonumber\\\\\n&= \\epsilon_2 P_{w_b}(s, s^{\\prime}).\n\\end{align}\n%\\end{equation}\nThe above bound of the deviation matrix $F$ in terms of $P_{w_b}$ compels us to apply the result from \\cite{xue1997note}, which provides a sensitivity analysis of the stationary distribution of a Markov chain \\emph{w.r.t.} its probability transition matrix. In particular, by appealing to Theorem $1$ of \\cite{xue1997note} along with Equation (\\ref{eq:fbddrv}), we obtain the following:\n\\begin{gather}\n\\Big\\vert \\frac{\\nu_w(s)-\\nu_{w_b}(s)}{\\nu_{w_b}(s)}\\Big\\vert \\leq 2(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert - 1) \\epsilon_2 + O(\\epsilon_2^{2}),\\hspace*{4mm} s \\in \\mathbb{S}. \\nonumber\\\\\n\\Longrightarrow \\Big\\vert \\frac{\\nu_w(s)-\\nu_{w_b}(s)}{\\nu_{w_b}(s)}\\Big\\vert \\leq O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert\\epsilon_2),\\hspace*{4mm} s \\in \\mathbb{S}.\\label{eq:bdstd}\n\\end{gather}\nLet $\\epsilon_3 = O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\epsilon_2)$. Then from (\\ref{eq:bdstd}), we get\n\\begin{gather}\n\\vert \\nu_w(s)-\\nu_{w_b}(s) \\vert \\leq \\epsilon_3\\vert \\nu_{w_b}(s) \\vert \\leq \\epsilon_3(\\vert \\nu_w(s)-\\nu_{w_b}(s) \\vert + \\vert \\nu_{w}(s) \\vert)\\nonumber\\\\\n\\Longrightarrow \\frac{\\vert \\nu_w(s)-\\nu_{w_b}(s)\\vert}{\\vert \\nu_{w}(s) \\vert} \\leq \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{1-\\epsilon_3} = O(\\epsilon_3 + \\epsilon^{2}_3) = O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert\\epsilon_2 + \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2}\\epsilon_2^{2}).\\label{eq:bdstd2}\n\\end{gather}\nFor the policy $\\pi_w$, recall that the on-policy approximation is $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w}$, where $x_{w \\vert w}$ is the unique solution to the linear system $A_{w \\vert w}x = b_{w \\vert w}$. Analogously, the off-policy approximation is given by $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b}$, where $x_{w \\vert w_b}$ is the unique solution to the linear system $A_{w \\vert w_b}x = b_{w \\vert w_b}$. Now using the bound in (\\ref{eq:bdstd2}) and the definitions of $A_{w \\vert w}$, $A_{w \\vert w_b}$, $b_{w \\vert w}$ and $b_{w \\vert w_b}$ in (\\ref{eq:onls}) and (\\ref{eq:offls}), it is easy to verify that\n\\begin{gather*}\n\\vert A_{w \\vert w_b} - A_{w \\vert w}\\vert \\leq O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2}\\epsilon_2^{2} + \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\epsilon_2)\\vert A_{w \\vert w} \\vert\\hspace*{0mm}\\textrm{ and }\\hspace*{0mm}\\\\ \\hspace*{20mm}\\vert b_{w \\vert w_b} - b_{w \\vert w}\\vert \\leq O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2}\\epsilon_2^{2} + \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\epsilon_2)\\vert b_{w \\vert w} \\vert.\n\\end{gather*}\nHence the off-policy linear system $A_{w \\vert w_b}x = b_{w \\vert w_b}$ can be viewed as a perturbed version of the on-policy system $A_{w \\vert w}x = b_{w \\vert w}$. Let $\\epsilon_4 = O(\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2}\\epsilon_2^{2} + \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\epsilon_2)$. Now we make use of the norm bound on the solutions of perturbed linear system of equations provided in Theorem $2.2$ of \\cite{higham1994survey}. In particular, using the remark following Theorem $2.2$ of \\cite{higham1994survey},  we have\n\\begin{gather}\\label{eq:normbd}\n\\frac{\\big\\Vert x_{w \\vert w} - x_{w \\vert w_b} \\big\\Vert_{\\infty}}{\\Vert  x_{w \\vert w} \\Vert_{\\infty}} \\leq \\frac{2\\epsilon_4\\kappa(A_{w \\vert w})}{1-\\epsilon_4\\kappa(A_{w \\vert w})},\n\\end{gather}\nwhere $\\kappa(A_{w \\vert w}) = \\Vert A_{w \\vert w} \\Vert_{\\infty} \\Vert A^{-1}_{w \\vert w}\\Vert_{\\infty}$ (condition number $\\kappa(\\cdot)$ is defined in Section \\ref{sec:summary}). Using the definition of $A_{w \\vert w}$ in (\\ref{eq:onls}), we obtain $A^{-1}_{w \\vert w} = \\Phi^{-1}(I-\\gamma P_{w})^{-1}(I-\\gamma \\lambda P_{w})(D^{\\nu_{w}})^{-1}\\Phi^{-\\top}$, where $\\Phi^{-1}$ is the left inverse of $\\Phi$ and $\\Phi^{-\\top}$ is the right inverse of $\\Phi^{\\top}$. Therefore $\\Vert A^{-1}_{w \\vert w} \\Vert_{\\infty} \\leq \\Vert\\Phi^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert(I-\\gamma P_{w})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert I-\\gamma \\lambda P_{w} \\Vert_{\\infty} \\Vert(D^{\\nu_{w}})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert\\Phi^{-\\top}\\Vert_{\\infty}$. Now by arguing along the same lines as (\\ref{eq:cr1_2}), one can show that $\\Vert(I-\\gamma P_{w})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty} \\leq \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$. Also $\\Vert I-\\gamma \\lambda P_{w} \\Vert_{\\infty} = 1+\\gamma\\lambda$. And the feature matrix $\\Phi$ is presumed to be constant. A forteriori, $\\Vert A^{-1}_{w \\vert w} \\Vert_{\\infty} = O(\\frac{1+\\gamma\\lambda}{1-\\gamma}\\Vert(D^{\\nu_{w}})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty})$. Also from (\\ref{eq:bdstd}), we have $\\nu_{w}(s) \\geq (1-\\epsilon_3)\\nu_{w_b}(s)$, $s \\in \\mathbb{S}$. Henceforth, $\\Vert A^{-1}_{w \\vert w} \\Vert_{\\infty} = O(\\frac{1+\\gamma\\lambda}{(1-\\gamma)(1-\\epsilon_3)}\\Vert(D^{\\nu_{w_b}})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty})$. Similarly, one can show that $\\Vert A_{w \\vert w} \\Vert_{\\infty} = O(\\frac{(1+\\gamma)(1+\\epsilon_3)}{(1-\\gamma\\lambda)}\\Vert D^{\\nu_{w_b}}\\Vert_{\\infty})$. Hence \\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\\hspace*{10mm}$\\kappa(A_{w \\vert w}) = O\\big(\\frac{(1+\\epsilon_3)(1+\\gamma)(1+\\gamma\\lambda)}{(1-\\gamma)(1-\\gamma\\lambda)(1-\\epsilon_3)}\\Vert D^{\\nu_{w_b}}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert(D^{\\nu_{w_b}})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\big)$, \\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\\hspace*{24mm}= $O\\big(\\frac{(1+\\epsilon_3)^{2}(1+\\gamma)(1+\\gamma\\lambda)}{(1-\\gamma)(1-\\gamma\\lambda)}\\Vert D^{\\nu_{w_b}}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert(D^{\\nu_{w_b}})^{-1}\\Vert_{\\infty}\\big)$.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\nConsequently from (\\ref{eq:normbd}), we get\n\\begin{flalign*}\n\\frac{\\big\\Vert x_{w \\vert w} -

The quantity $\\sup_{s \\in \\mathbb{S}, a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\Big\\vert \\frac{\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s)}{\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)}-1\\Big\\vert$ given in the hypothesis of the theorem\ncan ostensibly be viewed as a measure of the closeness of the SRPs $\\pi_w$ and $\\pi_{w_b}$, with the minimum value of $0$ being achieved in the on-policy case. Under the hypothesis that $\\sup_{s \\in \\mathbb{S}, a \\in \\mathbb{A}}\\Big\\vert \\frac{\\pi_{w}(a \\vert s)}{\\pi_{w_b}(a \\vert s)}-1\\Big\\vert < \\epsilon_2$, we obtain in (\\ref{eqn:thmbd1}) an upper bound on the relative error of the on-policy and off-policy solutions. The bound is predominantly dominated by the hypothesis bound $\\epsilon_2$, the eligibility factor $\\lambda$, the discount factor $\\gamma$ and $\\Vert (D^{\\nu_{w_b}})^{-1} \\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert D^{\\nu_{w_b}} \\Vert_{\\infty}$. Note that $\\Vert D^{\\nu_{w_b}} \\Vert_{\\infty} = \\max_{s} \\nu_{w_b}(s)$ and $\\Vert (D^{\\nu_{w_b}})^{-1} \\Vert_{\\infty} = (\\min_{s} \\nu_{w_b}(s))^{-1}$. If the behaviour policy is chosen in such a way that all the states are equally likely under its stationary distribution, then $\\Vert (D^{\\nu_{w_b}})^{-1} \\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert D^{\\nu_{w_b}} \\Vert_{\\infty} \\approx 1$. Consequently, the upper bound can be reduced to $O\\big((\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert^{2}\\epsilon^{2}_2 + \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert \\epsilon_2)\\frac{(1+\\gamma)(1+\\gamma\\lambda)}{(1-\\gamma)(1-\\gamma\\lambda)}\\big)$. \n\nNow regarding the latter bound provided in Equation (\\ref{eqn:thmbd2}), given $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, by using triangle inequality and Equation (\\ref{eqn:thmbd2}), we obtain a proper quantification of the distance between the solution of the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$), \\emph{i.e.}, $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b}$ and the projection $\\Pi^{w_b}V^{w}$ in terms of $\\Vert\\cdot\\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}$ and $\\epsilon_2$.  The above bound can be further improved by obtaining an expedient bound for  $\\Vert V^{w} - V^{w_b} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}$ as follows:\n\\begin{corollary}\nLet $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ and $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$. Let the assumptions of Theorem \\ref{thm:solbd} hold. Also, assume that $\\epsilon_2$ which is defined in Theorem \\ref{thm:solbd} satisfy $\\epsilon_2\\frac{1+\\gamma}{1-\\gamma} < 1$. Then $\\exists K_1 > 0$, s.t.\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\Vert \\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}} \\leq \n\\frac{K_1(\\gamma-2\\gamma\\lambda+1)(1+\\gamma)\\epsilon_2}{(1-\\gamma)(1-\\gamma-\\epsilon_2(1+\\gamma))} + \\frac{\\epsilon_2(1-\\gamma\\lambda)\\Vert R \\Vert_{\\infty}}{(1-\\gamma)^{2}} + \\\\&\\hspace*{60mm}\\frac{1-\\gamma\\lambda}{1-\\gamma}\\Vert \\Pi^{w_b}V^{w} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}},\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\end{corollary}\n\\begin{Proof}\nGiven $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, the value function $V^{w}$ satisfies the linear system given by the Bellman equation as shown in Equation (\\ref{eq:bellman}), \\emph{i.e.}, \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:lson}\n(I-\\gamma P_{w})V^{w} = R^{w}.\n\\end{equation}\nSimilarly, for the behaviour policy $w_b$, we have \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:lsoff}\n(I-\\gamma P_{w_b})V^{w_b} = R^{w_b}.\n\\end{equation}\nNow, note that\n\\begin{flalign*}\n&(I-\\gamma P_{w}) = (I-\\gamma P_{w_b}) + F, \\textrm{ where } F = \\gamma(P_{w_b} - P_{w}).\\\\\n&R^{w} = R^{w_b} + b, \\textrm{ where } b = R^{w} - R^{w_b}.\n\\end{flalign*}\nBy arguing along the same lines as (\\ref{eq:rbnd2}), one can show that $\\vert b(s) \\vert \\leq \\epsilon_2 \\vert  R^{w_b}(s) \\vert$, $\\forall s \\in \\mathbb{S}$. Similarly, $\\vert F(s, s^{\\prime}) \\vert \\leq \\epsilon_2 \\gamma \\vert P_{w_b}(s, s^{\\prime}) \\vert \\leq \\epsilon_2 \\vert (I-\\gamma P_{w_b})(s, s^{\\prime}) \\vert$, $\\forall s, s^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{S}$. (The proof is similar to that of (\\ref{eq:fbddrv})).\nHence the on-policy linear system given by (\\ref{eq:lson}) can be viewed as a perturbed version of the linear system (\\ref{eq:lsoff}) of the behaviour policy. So, using the remark following Theorem $2.2$ of \\cite{higham1994survey}, we obtain the following:\n\\begin{flalign}\\label{eq:cr1_1}\n\\frac{\\Vert V^{w} - V^{w_b} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}}{\\Vert V^{w_b} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}} \\leq \\frac{2\\epsilon_2\\kappa(I - \\gamma P_{w_b})}{1-\\epsilon_2\\kappa(I - \\gamma P_{w_b})}.\n\\end{flalign}\nwhere $\\kappa(I - \\gamma P_{w_b}) = \\Vert I - \\gamma P_{w_b} \\Vert_{\\infty}\\Vert (I - \\gamma P_{w_b})^{-1} \\Vert_{\\infty}$ (condition number $\\kappa(\\cdot)$ is defined in Section \\ref{sec:summary}). It is also easy to verify that $\\Vert I - \\gamma P_{w_b} \\Vert_{\\infty} = 1+\\gamma$. Now to bound $\\Vert (I - \\gamma P_{w_b})^{-1} \\Vert_{\\infty}$, we use the Ahlberg-Nilson-Varah bound from \\cite{varga1976diagonal}. In particular, by using Theorem A of \\cite{varga1976diagonal}, we have\n\\begin{flalign}\\label{eq:cr1_2}\n\\Vert (I - \\gamma P_{w_b})^{-1} \\Vert_{\\infty} &\\leq \\frac{1}{\\min_{1 \\leq i \\leq \\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}\\big\\{\\vert(I-\\gamma P_{w_b})_{ii}\\vert - \\sum_{j=1, j \\neq i }^{\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert}\\vert(I-\\gamma P_{w_b})_{ij}\\vert\\big\\}},\\nonumber\\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma},\n\\end{flalign}\nwhere $(\\cdot)_{ij}$ is the $(i,j)$ entry of the matrix.\\\\\nBy putting together the above facts, we get $\\kappa(I - \\gamma P_{w_b}) \\leq \\frac{1+\\gamma}{1-\\gamma}$. Consequently from Equation (\\ref{eq:cr1_1}) and the assumption that $\\epsilon_2\\frac{1+\\gamma}{1-\\gamma} < 1$, we obtain\n\\begin{flalign*}\n\\frac{\\Vert V^{w} - V^{w_b} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}}{\\Vert V^{w_b} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}} \\leq \\frac{2\\epsilon_2(1+\\gamma)}{1-\\gamma-\\epsilon_2(1+\\gamma)}.\n\\end{flalign*}\nTherefore $\\Vert V^{w} - V^{w_b} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}} \\leq K_{1}\\epsilon_2(1+\\gamma)(1-\\gamma-\\epsilon_2(1+\\gamma))^{-1}$, $K_1 > 0$. The corollary now easily follows from the above bound and from (\\ref{eqn:thmbd2}) of Theorem \\ref{thm:solbd}.\n\\end{Proof}\\\\\n%The choice of $\\lambda$ is arbitrary, hence by choosing $\\lambda \\thickapprox 1$, the bound in the above corollary can be reduced to $\\Vert \\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}} \\leq O\\left(\\epsilon_2\\big(\\frac{(1-\\gamma)}{(1+\\gamma)}-\\epsilon_2\\big)^{-1}\\right) + \\Vert \\Pi^{w_b}V^{w} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w_b}}$. This shows that the approximation using the behaviour policy is dependent on the discount factor $\\gamma$, with $\\gamma \\thickapprox 1$ giving the best approximation, while the worst performance is obtained in cases where the dependency on the future payoffs is less, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\gamma \\approx 0$.\n\nThe note worthy result on the upper bound of the approximation error of the on-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) provided in \\cite{tsitsiklis1997analysis} can be easily derived from the above result as follows:\n\\begin{corollary}\nFor $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ and $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$,\n\\begin{flalign*}\n\\Vert \\Phi x_{w \\vert w} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w}} \\leq \\frac{1-\\gamma\\lambda}{1-\\gamma}\\Vert \\Pi^{w}V^{w} - V^{w} \\Vert_{\\nu_{w}}.\n\\end{flalign*}\n\\end{corollary}\n\\begin{Proof}\nIn the on-policy case, $w_b = w$. Hence $\\epsilon_2 = 0$. The corollary directly follows from direct substitution of these values in (\\ref{eqn:thmbd2}).\n\\end{Proof}\n\\subsection{Estimation of the Objective Function: } \nThe objective function of the control problem defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}) is \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:trobj}\nJ(w) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w}}\\left[L(h_{w \\vert w})\\right].\n\\end{equation}\nIn this paper, we employ off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) to approximate $h_{w \\vert w}$ for a given policy parameter $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$. A sample trajectory $\\{\\mathbf{s}_{0}, \\mathbf{a}_0, \\mathbf{r}_{0}, \\mathbf{s}_{1}, \\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{r}_{1}, \\mathbf{s}_{2}, \\dots \\}$ (fixed for the algorithm) generated using the behaviour policy $\\pi_{w_b}$  is provided. \n\nThe procedure to estimate the objective function $J$ is formally defined in Algorithm \\ref{algo:predict}. The \\textit{Predict} procedure in Algorithm \\ref{algo:predict} is almost the same as the off-policy LSTD algorithm. The additional recursion (step $10$)  estimates the objective function defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:trobj}) as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:lweqval}\n\\ell_{k+1}^{w} = \\ell_{k}^{w} + \\alpha_{k+1}\\Big(L(\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) - \\ell_{k}^{w}\\Big),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha_{k} = 1/k$. The above choice of $\\alpha_k$ is merely a recommendation and not a strict requirement. This, however, alleviates the extra burden of deciding $\\alpha_k$ during implementation.  \n\nFor a given $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, $\\ell_{k}^{w}$ attempts to find an approximate value of the objective function $J(w)$. The following lemma formally characterizes the limiting behaviour of the iterates $\\ell_{k}^{w}$.\n\\begin{lemma} \\label{lmn:jw}\nFor a given $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$,\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:jwconv}\n\\ell_{k}^{w} \\rightarrow \\ell^{w}_{*} = \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}))\\right] \\textrm{ as } k \\rightarrow \\infty \\textrm{ w.p. 1.}\n\\end{equation}\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{Proof}\nWe begin the proof by defining the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, where the $\\sigma$-field $\\mathcal{F}_{k} \\triangleq \\sigma(\\{\\mathbf{x}_{i}, \\ell^{w}_{i}, \\mathbf{s}_{i}, \\mathbf{a}_{i}, \\mathbf{r}_{i}, 0 \\leq i \\leq k \\})$.\\\\\\\\\nNow recalling the recursion (\\ref{eq:lweqval}),\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell_{k+1}^{w} &:= \\ell_{k}^{w} + \\alpha_{k+1}\\Big(L(\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) - \\ell_{k}^{w}\\Big)\\hspace*{20mm}\\\\\n&:= \\ell_{k}^{w} + \\alpha_{k+1}\\Big(h(\\ell_{k}^{w}) + \\mathbb{M}_{k+1} + c_k\\Big),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $\\mathbb{M}_{k+1} \\triangleq L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) - \\mathbb{E}\\left[L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) \\big\\vert \\mathcal{F}_{k}\\right]$, \\\\$h(z) \\triangleq  \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1}))\\right] - z$ and $c_k \\triangleq L(\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) - L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) + $\\\\ $\\mathbb{E}\\left[L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) \\big\\vert \\mathcal{F}_{k}\\right] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1}))\\right]$.\\\\\\\\\nWe state here few observations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $\\{\\mathbb{M}_{k}, k \\geq 1\\}$ is a martingale difference noise sequence \\emph{w.r.t.} $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{k}\\}$, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\mathbb{M}_{k}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{k}$-measurable, integrable and $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{M}_{k+1} \\vert \\mathcal{F}_{k}] = 0$ \\emph{a.s.}, $\\forall k \\geq 0$.\n\\item $h(\\cdot)$ is a Lipschitz continuous function.\n\\item $\\exists K > 0$ \\emph{s.t.} $\\mathbb{E}[\\vert \\mathbb{M}_{k+1} \\vert^{2} \\vert \\mathcal{F}_{k}] \\leq K(1+\\vert \\ell_{k} \\vert^{2})$ \\emph{a.s.}, $\\forall k \\geq 0$.\n\\item \nBy Theorem \\ref{thm:offplcy}, $c_k \\rightarrow 0$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ \\emph{w.p. 1}. This directly follows by considering the following facts: (a) by Equation (\\ref{thm:offplcy}), the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) iterates $\\{\\mathbf{x}_{k}\\}$ converges almost surely to the off-policy solution $x_{w \\vert w_b}$ (b) by assumption (A2), $P_{w_b}(\\mathbf{s}_{k} = s) \\rightarrow \\nu_{w_b}(s)$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ and (c) $L(\\cdot)$ and $\\phi(\\cdot)$ are bounded.\n\\item For a given $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, the iterates $\\{l_{k}^{w}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ are stable, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\sup_{k} \\vert \\ell_{k}^{w} \\vert < \\infty$ \\emph{a.s.} A brief proof is provided here: For $c > 0$, we define \n\\begin{equation}\nh_{c}(z) \\triangleq \\frac{h(cz)}{c} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x_{w \\vert w_b}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}))\\right]}{c} - z. \n\\end{equation}\nNow consider the following ODE corresponding to the following $\\infty$-system: \n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot{z}(t) = h_{\\infty}(z(t)) \\triangleq \\lim_{c \\rightarrow \\infty}h_{c}(z(t)). \n\\end{equation}\nNote that $h_{\\infty}(z) = -z$. It can be easily verified that the above ODE is globally asymptotically stable to the origin. This further implies the stability of the iterates $\\{\\ell_{k}^{w}\\}$ using Theorem $2$, Chapter $3$ of \\cite{borkar2008stochastic}.\n\\end{enumerate}\nNow by appealing to the third extension of Theorem $2$, Section $2.2$, Chapter $2$ of \\cite{borkar2008stochastic} and from the above observations, we can henceforth conclude almost surely that the iterates $\\{\\ell_{k}^{w}\\}$ asymptotically track the ODE given by:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:odeJk}\n\\dot{z}(t) = h(z(t)).\n\\end{equation}\nThis further implies that the limit points of the iterates $\\{\\ell_{k}^{w}\\}$ are indeed contained in the limit set of the ODE (\\ref{eq:odeJk}) almost surely. However, it is easy to verify that $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x^{\\top}_{w \\vert w_b}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}))\\right]$ is the unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of the ODE (\\ref{eq:odeJk}). Hence $\\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\ell_{k}^{w} = \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x^{\\top}_{w \\vert w_b}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}))\\right]$ \\emph{a.s.} This completes the proof of (\\ref{eq:jwconv}). \n\\end{Proof}\\\\\n\\begin{remark}\nBy the above lemma, for a given $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, the quantity $\\ell_{k}^{w}$ tracks $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x^{\\top}_{w \\vert w_b}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}))\\right]$. This is however different from the true objective function value $J(w) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w}}\\left[L(h_{w \\vert w})\\right]$, when $w \\neq w_b$. This additional approximation error incurred is the extra cost one has to pay for the dearth in information (in the form of generative model) about the underlying MDP. Nevertheless, from Equations (\\ref{eqn:thmbd1}) and (\\ref{eq:bdstd}), we know that the relative errors in the solutions $x_{w\\vert w}$ and $x_{w \\vert w_b}$ as well as in the stationary distributions $\\nu_{w}$ and $\\nu_{w_b}$ are small. We also know that $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w} \\approx h_{w \\vert w}$. Further, if we can restrict the smoothness of the performance function $L$, then we can contain the deviation of $L(y)$  when the input variable $y$ is perturbed slightly. All these factors further affirm the fact that the approximation proposed in (\\ref{eq:lweqval}) is  well-conditioned. This is indeed significant, considering the restricted setting we operate in, \\emph{i.e.}, non-availability of the generative model.\n\\end{remark}\n\\scalebox{1.05}{\n\\begin{minipage}{0.94001\\linewidth}\n\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n\\caption{Predict Procedure}\\label{algo:predict}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\State \\textbf{Input parameters: } $w \\in \\mathbb{W}$, $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ \\hspace*{1mm}$\\blacktriangleright \\textit{Input policy vector, Trajectory length}$\n\\State \\textbf{Data: } \\textit{A priori chosen sample trajectory $\\{s_{0}, a_0, r_{0}, s_{1}, a_1, r_{1}, s_{2}, \\dots \\}$ generated using the behaviour policy $\\pi_{w_b}$}\n\\Function{Predict($w$, $N$)}{}\n\\State $k := 0$;\\hspace*{10mm}$\\blacktriangleright \\textit{Iteration count initialized to } 0$\n\\While{$k < N$} \n\\State $\\mathbf{e}_{k+1} := \\gamma\\lambda \\rho_{k} \\mathbf{e}_k + \\phi(s_k)$;\\hspace*{5mm}$\\blacktriangleright \\textit{ The sampling ratio }$ $\\rho_k = \\frac{\\pi_{w}(a_{k} \\vert s_{k})}{\\pi_{w_b}(a_{k} \\vert s_{k})}$\n\\State $\\mathbf{A}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{A}_{k} + \\frac{1}{k+1}\\left(\\mathbf{e}_k(\\phi(s_{k})-\\gamma\\rho_{k}\\phi(s_{k+1}))^{\\top} - \\mathbf{A}_k\\right)$;\n\\State $\\mathbf{b}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{b}_{k} + \\frac{1}{k+1}(\\rho_{k}r_{k}\\mathbf{e}_k -   \\mathbf{b}_k)$;\n\\State $\\mathbf{x}_{k+1} := \\mathbf{A}^{-1}_{k+1}\\mathbf{b}_{k+1}$;\\hspace*{10mm}$\\blacktriangleright \\textit{Prediction vector}$\n\\State $\\ell_{k+1}^{w} := \\ell_{k}^{w} + \\alpha_{k+1}\\Big(L(\\mathbf{x}_{k}^{\\top}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}_{k+1})) - \\ell_{k}^{w}\\Big)$;\\hspace*{2mm}$\\blacktriangleright \\textit{Objective func estimation}$\\label{line:jw}\n\\State $k := k + 1$;\n\\EndWhile\n\\State \\textbf{return }$\\ell_{N}^{w}$;\\hspace*{10mm}$\\blacktriangleright \\textit{Outputs after } N \\textit{ iterations}$\n\\EndFunction\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\\end{minipage}}\n\\subsection{Stochastic Approximation Version of Gaussian Cross Entropy Method and its Application to the Control Problem}\nCross entropy method \\cite{rubinstein2013cross,kroese2006cross} solves optimization problems where the objective function does not possess good structural properties, such as possibly discontinuous, non-differentiable, \\emph{i.e.}, those of the kind:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\textrm{Find } x^{*} \\in \\argmax_{x \\in \\mathbb{X} \\subset \\bbbr^{d}} J(x),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $J:\\mathbb{X} \\rightarrow \\bbbr$ is a bounded Borel measurable function.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\nCE is a \\textit{model based search method} \\cite{zlochin2004model} used to solve the global optimization problem.

However, in this paper, we do not explore the possibility of employing the above algorithms in a MDP setting.\n\nThe Gaussian based cross entropy generates a sequence of Gaussian distributions ${\\{\\theta_{j} = (\\mu_{j}, \\Sigma_{j})^{\\top} \\in \\Theta \\subset \\bbbr^{d(d+1)}\\}}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ parametrized by its mean vector $\\mu_{j} \\in \\bbbr^{d}$ and the covariance matrix $\\Sigma_{j} \\in \\bbbr^{d \\times d}$, with the property that the support of the multivariate Gaussian probability density function given by \\[f_{\\theta_{j+1}}(x) = (2\\pi|\\Sigma_{j+1}|)^{-d/2}\\exp{(-\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\mu_{j+1})^{\\top}\\Sigma_{j+1}^{-1}(x-\\mu_{j+1}))}\\] satisfies (P1) below.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Property (P1) }\\normalsize$supp(f_{\\theta_{j+1}}) \\subseteq \\{x \\vert J(x) \\geq \\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\theta_{j})\\}$,\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\nwhere $\\rho \\in (0,1)$ is fixed \\emph{a priori}. Note that $\\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\theta_{j})$ is the $(1-\\rho)$-quantile of $J$ \\emph{w.r.t.} the distribution $f_{\\theta_{j}}$. Hence it is easy to verify that the \\textit{threshold sequence } $\\{\\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\theta_{j})\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a monotonically non-decreasing sequence. The intuition behind this recursive generation of the model sequence is that by assigning greater weight to the higher values of $J$ at each iteration, the expected behaviour of the model sequence should improve. We make the following assumption on the model parameter space $\\Theta$:\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n$\\circledast$ \\textbf{Assumption (A5) } \\normalsize\\textit{The parameter space $\\Theta$ is a compact subset of $\\bbbr^{d(d+1)}$}.\\vspace*{3mm}\\\\\nThe invariant in each iteration of the CE method is property (P1). The CE method maintains this invariant by solving at each instant $j+1$, the following optimization problem:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:opt1}\n%\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta_{j+1} = \\argmax_{\\theta \\in \\Theta}\\Gamma_{j}(\\theta, \\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\theta_{j})),\n%\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\Gamma_{j}(\\theta, \\gamma) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}_{\\theta_{j}}\\left[\\varphi(J(\\mathbf{x}))I_{\\bm{\\{}J(\\mathbf{x}) \\geq \\gamma\\bm{\\}}}\\log{f_\\theta(\\mathbf{x})}\\right]$ and $\\varphi:\\bbbr \\rightarrow \\bbbr_{+}$ is a positive, strictly monotonically increasing function. This recursive equation forms the basis of the cross entropy method and is referred to as the \\textit{model update procedure}.\\\\\nNote that the solution to Equation (\\ref{eq:opt1}) is obtained by equating $\\nabla \\Gamma_{j}$ to $0$:\n\\begin{gather} \n\\nabla_{\\vartheta^{\\theta}_1}\\Gamma_{j}(\\theta, \\gamma) = 0 \\hspace*{3mm}\\bm{\\Rightarrow}\\hspace*{3mm} \\mu = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta_j}\\left[\\mathbf{g_{1}}\\bm{\\big{(}}J(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{x}, \\gamma\\bm{\\big{)}}\\right]}{\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta_{j}}\\left[\\mathbf{g_{0}}(J(\\mathbf{x}), \\gamma)\\right]} \\hspace*{3mm}\\triangleq \\hspace*{3mm} \\Upsilon_{1}(\\theta_{j}, \\gamma),\\label{eq:sigmaideal1}\\hspace*{5mm}\\\\\n\\nabla_{\\vartheta^{\\theta}_2}\\Gamma_{j}(\\theta, \\gamma) = 0 \\hspace*{3mm}\\bm{\\Rightarrow}\\hspace*{3mm} \\Sigma =  \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta_{j}}\\left[\\mathbf{g_{2}}\\bm{\\big{(}}J(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{x}, \\gamma, \\mu\\bm{\\big{)}}\\right]}{\\mathbb{E}_{\\theta_{j}}\\left[\\mathbf{g_{0}}\\bm{\\big{(}}J(\\mathbf{x}), \\gamma\\bm{\\big{)}}\\right]} \\hspace*{3mm} \\triangleq \\hspace*{3mm} \\Upsilon_{2}(\\theta_{j}, \\gamma),\\label{eq:sigmaideal2}\n\\end{gather} \n\\begin{subequations}\n\\begin{empheq}{align}\n&\\hspace*{-17mm}\\textrm{ where }\\hspace*{4mm}\\mathbf{g_{0}}\\bm{(}y, \\gamma\\bm{)} \\triangleq \\varphi(y)I_{\\bm{\\{}y \\geq \\gamma\\bm{\\}}}, \\hspace*{40mm}\\\\ \n&\\mathbf{g_{1}}\\bm{(}y, x, \\gamma\\bm{)} \\triangleq x\\varphi(y)I_{\\bm{\\{}y \\geq \\gamma\\bm{\\}}}, \\hspace*{31mm}\\\\\n&\\hspace*{0mm}\\mathbf{g_{2}}\\bm{(}y, x, \\gamma, \\mu\\bm{)} \\triangleq \\varphi(y)(x-\\mu)(x-\\mu)^{\\top}I_{\\bm{\\{}y \\geq \\gamma\\bm{\\}}}\\\\ \n&(\\vartheta^{\\theta}_1, \\vartheta^{\\theta}_2)^{\\top} = (\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu, -\\frac{1}{2}\\Sigma^{-1})^{\\top}.\\hspace*{27mm} \n\\end{empheq}\n\\end{subequations}\nThe mapping of $(\\mu, \\Sigma)^{\\top} \\mapsto (\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu, \\frac{-1}{2}\\Sigma^{-1})^{\\top}$ is a bijective transformation and it makes the algebra a lot simpler. Also it is not hard to verify that $\\Upsilon_1$ and $\\Upsilon_2$ are well defined. \n\nNow from (\\ref{eq:sigmaideal1}) and (\\ref{eq:sigmaideal2}), we can rewrite the recursion (\\ref{eq:opt1}) as \n\\begin{equation}\n\\theta_{j+1} = \\big(\\Upsilon_{1}\\left(\\theta_{j}, \\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\theta_{j})\\right), \\Upsilon_{2}\\left(\\theta_{j}, \\gamma_{\\rho}\\left(J, \\theta_{j}\\right)\\right)\\big)^{\\top}.\n \\end{equation}\nFrom the definition of $\\Upsilon_1$ and $\\Upsilon_2$ , note that $f_{\\theta_{j+1}}$ also satisfies property (P1) and hence the invariance is maintained. The above update rule for recursively generating model sequence $\\{\\theta_{j}\\}$ is commonly referred to as the \\textit{ideal version of the standard CE method}. However, in this paper, we employ an extended version of the CE method proposed in \\cite{predictsce2016,genstochce2016,ajincedet} whose update rule is slightly different. In the extended version, a mixture PDF $\\widehat{f}_{\\theta_j} = (1-\\zeta)f_{\\theta_{j}} + \\zeta f_{\\theta_0}$ (with $\\zeta \\in (0,1)$ and $\\theta_0$ is the initial distribution parameter) is employed to compute $\\gamma_{\\rho}$, $\\Upsilon_1$ and $\\Upsilon_2$ instead of the original PDF $f_{\\theta_j}$. In this case, the update rule is defined as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:mixcemethod}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta_{j+1} = \\left(\\Upsilon_{1}\\left(\\widehat{\\theta}_{j}, \\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\widehat{\\theta}_{j})\\right), \\Upsilon_{2}\\left(\\widehat{\\theta}_{j}, \\gamma_{\\rho}\\left(J, \\widehat{\\theta}_{j}\\right)\\right)\\right)^{\\top}.\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nHere $\\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\widehat{\\theta})$ is defined as the $(1-\\rho)$-quantile of $J$ \\emph{w.r.t.} the mixture distribution $\\widehat{f}_{\\theta}$. Similarly we define  $\\Upsilon_1(\\widehat{\\theta}, \\cdot)$ and $\\Upsilon_2(\\widehat{\\theta}, \\cdot)$ respectively. This extended version is shown to exhibit global optimum convergence \\cite{predictsce2016,genstochce2016,ajincedet}.\n\nHowever, there are certain tractability concerns. The quantities $\\gamma_{\\rho}(J, \\widehat{\\theta}_{j})$, $\\Upsilon_{1}(\\widehat{\\theta}_{j}, \\cdot)$ and $\\Upsilon_{2}(\\widehat{\\theta}_{j}, \\cdot)$ involved in the update rule are intractable, \\emph{i.e.} computationally hard to compute (and hence  the tag name `\\textit{ideal}\').  To overcome this, a naive approach usually found in the literature is to employ sample averaging, with sample size increasing to infinity. However, this approach suffers from hefty storage and computational complexity which is primarily attributed to the accumulation and processing of huge number of samples. In \\cite{predictsce2016,genstochce2016,ajincedet}, a stochastic approximation variant of the extended cross entropy method has been proposed. The proposed approach is efficient both computationally and storage wise, when compared to the rest of the state-of-the-art CE tracking methods \\cite{hu2012stochastic,wang2013parameter,kroese2006cross}. It also integrates the mixture approach (\\ref{eq:mixcemethod}) and henceforth exhibits global optimum convergence.\n\nThe goal of the stochastic approximation (SA) version of Gaussian CE method is to find a sequence of Gaussian model parameters $\\{\\theta_j = (\\mu_j, \\Sigma_j)^{\\top}\\}$ (where $\\mu_j$ is the mean vector and $\\Sigma_j$ is the covariance matrix) which tracks the ideal CE method. The algorithm efficiently accomplishes the goal by employing multiple stochastic approximation recursions. The algorithm is shown \n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\\textwidth}\n\\vspace*{-5mm}\n  \\begin{center}\n   \\fbox{\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth, height=30mm]{cegd-crop}}\n  \\end{center}\n  \\vspace*{-2mm}\n  \\caption{Illustration of the  sequence $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ generated by the CE method}\n  \\vspace*{-5mm}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\nto exhibit global optimum convergence, \\emph{i.e.}, the model sequence $\\{\\theta_{j}\\}$ converges to the degenerate distribution concentrated on any of the global optima of the objective function, in both deterministic (when the objective function is deterministic) and stochastic settings, \\emph{i.e.}, when noisy versions of the objective function are available. Successful application of the stochastic approximation version of CE in stochastic settings is appealing to the control problem we consider in this paper, since the off-policy LSTD($\\lambda$) method only provides estimates of the value function.\nThe SA version of CE is a discrete evolutionary procedure where the model sequence $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ is adapted to the degenerate distribution concentrated at global optima, where at each discrete step of the evolution a single sample from the solution space is used. This unique nature of the SA version is appealing to settings where the objective function values are hard to obtain, especially to the MDP control problem we consider in this paper. The single sample requirement attribute which is unique to the SA version implies that one does not need to scale the computing machine for unnecessary value function evaluations.\n\nOur algorithm which attempts to solve the control problem defined in Equation (\\ref{eq:modctrl}) is formally illustrated in Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd}.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\nA few remarks about the algorithm are in order:\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n1. The learning rates $\\{\\overbar{\\beta}_{j}\\}$, $\\{\\beta_{j}\\}$ and the mixing weight $\\zeta$ are deterministic, non-increasing and satisfy the following:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:lrnrate}\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\zeta \\in (0, 1), \\hspace*{2mm}&\\beta_{j} > 0, \\hspace*{2mm}\\overbar{\\beta}_{j} > 0, \n\\\\ &\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\beta_{j}  = \\infty, \\hspace*{5mm} \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\overbar{\\beta}_{j}  = \\infty, \\hspace*{4mm}\\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\beta^{2}_{j}+\\bar{\\beta}^{2}_{j}\\right) < \\infty.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n2. In our algorithm, the objective function is estimated in (\\ref{eqn:ce2lstd}) using the \\textit{Predict} procedure which is defined in Algorithm \\ref{algo:predict}. Even though an infinitely long sample trajectory is assumed  to be available, the \\textit{Predict} procedure has to practically terminate after processing a finite number of transitions from the trajectory. Hence a user configured trajectory length rule $\\{N_{j} \\in \\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ with $N_{j} \\uparrow \\infty$ is used. At each iteration $j$ of the cross entropy method, when \\textit{Predict} procedure is invoked to estimate the objective function $L(h_{w_j \\vert w_j})$, the procedure terminates after processing the first $N_{j}$ transitions in the trajectory. It is also important to note that the same sample trajectory is reused for all invocations of \\textit{Predict}. This eliminates the need for any further observations of the MDP.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n3. Recall that we employ the stochastic approximation (SA) version of the extended CE method to solve our control problem (\\ref{eq:modctrl}).  The SA version (hence Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd}) maintains three variables: $\\gamma_j, \\xi^{(0)}_{j}$ and $\\xi^{(1)}_{j}$, with $\\gamma_j$ tracking $\\gamma_{\\rho}(\\cdot, \\theta_j)$, while $\\xi^{(0)}_j$ and $\\xi^{(1)}_j$ track $\\Upsilon_1(\\theta_j, \\cdot)$ and $\\Upsilon_2(\\theta_j, \\cdot)$ respectively. Their stochastic recursions are defined in Equations (\\ref{eq:gammaeq}), (\\ref{eq:etaeq}) and (\\ref{eq:xieq}) of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd}. The increment terms for their respective stochastic recursions are defined recursively as follows:\n\\begin{align}\n&\\Delta \\gamma_{j}(y) \\triangleq -(1-\\rho)I_{\\{y \\geq \\gamma_j\\}}+\\rho I_{\\{y \\leq \\gamma_j\\}}.\\\\\n&\\Delta \\xi^{(0)}_{j}(x, y) \\triangleq \\mathbf{g_{1}}(y, x, \\gamma_j) - \\xi^{(0)}_j \\mathbf{g_{0}}(y, \\gamma_j).\\\\\n&\\Delta \\xi^{(1)}_{j}(x, y) \\triangleq \\mathbf{g_{2}}(y, x, \\gamma_j, \\xi^{(0)}_j) - \\xi^{(1)}_j \\mathbf{g_{0}}(y, \\gamma_j).\n\\end{align}\n4. The initial distribution parameter $\\theta_0$ is chosen by hand such that probability density function $f_{\\theta_0}$ has strictly positive values for every point in the solution space $\\mathbb{W}$, \\emph{i.e.}, $f_{\\theta_0}(w) > 0, \\forall w \\in \\mathbb{W}$.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n5. The stopping rule we adopt here for the control problem is to terminate the algorithm when the model sequence $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ is sufficiently close consequently for a finitely long time, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\exists \\bar{j} \\geq 0$ \\emph{s.t.} $\\Vert \\theta_j - \\theta_{j+1} \\Vert < \\delta_1$, $\\bar{j} \\leq \\forall j \\leq \\bar{j}+N(\\delta_1)$, where $\\delta_1 \\in \\bbbr_{+}$, $N(\\delta_1) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ are decided \\emph{a priori}.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n6. The quantile factor $\\rho$ is also a relevant parameter of the CE method. An empirical analysis in \\cite{predictsce2016} has revealed that the convergence rate of the algorithm is sensitive to the choice of $\\rho$. The paper also recommends that $[0.01, 0.3]$ is the most suitable choice of $\\rho$.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n7. We also extended the algorithm to include Polyak averaging of the model sequence $\\{\\theta_j\\}$. The sequence $\\{\\overbar{\\theta}_{j}\\}$ maintains the Polyak averages of the sequence $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ and its update step is given in (\\ref{eq:algbarth}). Note that the Polyak averaging \\cite{polyak1992acceleration} is a double averaging technique which does not cripple the convergence of the original sequence $\\{\\theta_j\\}$, however it reduces the variance of the iterates and accelerates the convergence of the sequence.\\\\\n%\\newpage\n\\noindent\n\\scalebox{0.99}{\n\\hspace*{0mm}\\begin{minipage}{1.001\\linewidth}\n%\\newpage\n\\begin{algorithm}[H]\n   \\caption{}\\label{alg:ce2-nd}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\\vspace*{1mm}\n\t\\State \\textbf{Input parameters: } {\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{-8pt}\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{4pt}\\begin{flalign*}\n\\hspace*{30mm}\\epsilon, \\rho \\in (0,1), \\bar{\\beta}_j, \\beta_j, \\zeta, c_j \\in (0,1), c_j \\rightarrow 0, \\theta_{0} := (\\mu_0, \\Sigma_0)^{\\top},\\hspace*{9mm}\\vspace*{4mm}\\\\\n\t\\hspace*{10mm}\\{N_j, j \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\hspace*{4mm}\\blacktriangleright \\textit{Trajectory length rule chosen a priori}\n\\end{flalign*}}\n\t\\State \\textbf{Initialization:} $j := 0, \\gamma_0 := 0$, $\\xi^{(0)}_0 := 0_{k_{2} \\times 1}$, $\\xi^{(1)}_{0} := 0_{k_{2} \\times k_{2}}$, $T_{0} := 0$, $\\theta^{p} = NULL$, $\\gamma^{p}_{0} := -\\infty$. \\vspace*{3mm}\n\t\\While{stopping criteria not satisfied}\n%\t\\State \\begin{equation}\n%\t\\begin{aligned}\n%\t\\end{aligned}\n%\t\\end{equation}\n%\t\\State \\begin{equation}\\label{eqn:ce2lstd}\n%\t\\begin{aligned}\n%\t\\end{aligned}\n%\t\\end{equation}\n\t%\\begin{eqnarray}\n\t\\vspace*{3mm}\n\t\\State {\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{-11pt}\\begin{flalign}\n\t\\hspace*{-10mm}\\textbf{Mixtrure distribution generation: }\\widehat{f}_{\\theta_j} := (1-\\zeta)f_{\\theta_{j}} + \\zeta f_{\\theta_0};

However, for completeness, we will restate the results here. We do not give proof of those results, however, provide references for the same. The additional Polyak averaging (step 18 of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd}) requires analysis, which is covered below.\n\nNote that Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd} employs the off-policy prediction method for estimating the objective function. In particular, in step 6 of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd}, we have $\\hat{J}(\\mathbf{w}_{j+1}) := Predict(\\mathbf{w}_{j+1}, N_{j+1})$, which converges to $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x^{\\top}_{w \\vert w_b}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}))\\right]$ almost surely as $N_j \\rightarrow \\infty$ ( by Lemma \\ref{lmn:jw}). Hence the objective function optimized by Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd} is $J_b(w) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_{w_b}}\\left[L(x^{\\top}_{w \\vert w_b}\\phi(\\mathbf{s}))\\right]$, where $w_b \\in \\mathbb{W}$ is the chosen behaviour policy vector.\n\nAlso note that the model parameter $\\theta_{j}$ in Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd} is not updated at each iteration $j$. Rather it is updated whenever $T_{j}$ hits the $\\epsilon$ threshold (step 15 of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd}), where $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1)$ is a constant. So the update of $\\theta_{j}$ only happens along a sub-sequence $\\{j_{(n)}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of $\\{j\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$. Between $j = j_{(n)}$ and $j = j_{(n+1)}$, the model parameter $\\theta_j$ remains constant and the variable $\\gamma_{j}$ estimates $(1-\\rho)$-quantile of  $J_b$  \\emph{w.r.t.}  $\\widehat{f}_{\\theta_{j_{(n)}}}$.\\\\\\\\\n\\textbf{Notation: } We denote by $\\gamma_{\\rho}(J_b, \\widehat{\\theta}))$, the $(1-\\rho)$-quantile of $J_b$ \\emph{w.r.t.} the mixture distribution $\\widehat{f}_{\\theta}$ and let $E_{\\widehat{\\theta}}[\\cdot]$ be the expectation \\emph{w.r.t} $\\widehat{f}_{\\theta}$.\\\\\n\nSince the model parameter $\\theta_j$ remains constant between $j = j_{(n)}$ and $j = j_{(n+1)}$, the convergence behaviour of $\\gamma_j$, $\\xi^{(0)}_j$ and $\\xi^{(1)}_j$ can be studied by keeping $\\theta_j$ constant.\n\\begin{lemma}\n\tLet $\\theta_{j} \\equiv \\theta, \\forall j$.

The following theorem shows that the model sequence $\\{\\theta_{j}\\}$ and the averaged sequence $\\{\\overbar{\\theta}_{j}\\}$ generated by Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd} converge to the degenerate distribution concentrated on the global maximum of the objective function $J_b$.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:main}\n\tLet $\\varphi(x) = exp(rx), r \\in \\bbbr$.  Let $\\rho, \\zeta \\in (0,1)$. Let the learning rates $\\{\\overbar{\\beta}_{j}\\}$ and $\\{\\beta_{j}\\}$ satisfy Equation (\\ref{eqn:lrnrate}). Assume $J_b \\in \\mathcal{C}^{2}$. Let $\\{\\theta_{j} = (\\mu_{j}, \\Sigma_{j})\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ and $\\{\\overbar{\\theta}_{j} = (\\overbar{\\mu}_{j}, \\overbar{\\Sigma}_{j})\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be the sequences generated by Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd} and also assume $\\theta_{j} \\in \\Theta$, $\\forall j \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $\\overbar{\\beta}_{j} = \\mathit{o}(\\beta_{j})$. Let $w_b \\in \\mathbb{W}$ be the chosen behaviour policy vector. Also, let the assumptions (A1-A5) hold.

This implies that the updates of $\\theta_j$ in (\\ref{eq:algth}) are larger than those of $\\overbar{\\theta}_j$ in (\\ref{eq:algbarth}). Hence the sequence $\\{\\theta_{j}\\}$ appears quasi-convergent when viewed from the  timescale of $\\{\\overbar{\\theta}_{j}\\}$ sequence.\n\n\tTheorem $2$ of \\cite{predictsce2016} analyses the limiting behaviour of the stochastic recursion (\\ref{eq:algth}) of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd} in great detail. The analysis discloses the global optimum convergence of the algorithm under limited regularity conditions. It is shown that the model sequence $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ converges almost surely to the degenerate distribution concentrated on the global optimum. The proposed regularity conditions for the global optimum convergence are that the objective function belongs to $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$ and the existence of a Lyapunov function on the neighbourhood of the degenerate distribution concentrated on the global optimum. This justifies the hypothesis $J_{b} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{2}$ in the statement of the theorem and we further assume the existence of a Lyapunov function on the neighbourhood of the degenerate distribution $(w^{b*}, 0_{k_2 \\times k_2})^{\\top}$. Then by Theorem $2$ of \\cite{predictsce2016}, we deduce that $\\{\\theta_j\\}$ converges to $(w^{b*}, 0_{k_2 \\times k_2})^{\\top}$. This completes the proof of (\\ref{eq:thconv}).\\\\\\\\\nFor brevity, lets define $\\theta^{*} \\triangleq (w^{b*}, 0_{k_2 \\times k_2})^{\\top}$. We also define the filtration $\\{\\overbar{\\mathcal{F}}_{j}\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, where the $\\sigma$-field $\\overbar{\\mathcal{F}}_{j} \\triangleq \\sigma(\\theta_{i}, \\overbar{\\theta}_i, 0 \\leq i \\leq j \\})$. Now recalling recursion (\\ref{eq:algbarth}),\n\\begin{align*}\n\\overbar{\\theta}_{j+1} &:= \\overbar{\\theta}_{j} + \\overbar{\\beta}_{j+1}\\left(\\theta_{j+1} - \\overbar{\\theta}_{j}\\right),\\\\\n&:= \\overbar{\\theta}_{j} + \\overbar{\\beta}_{j+1}\\left(\\theta_{j} - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\theta_{j+1} \\vert \\overbar{\\mathcal{F}}_{j}\\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\theta_{j+1} \\vert \\overbar{\\mathcal{F}}_{j}\\right] - \\theta^{*} + \\theta^{*} - \\overbar{\\theta}_{j}\\right),\\\\\n&:= \\overbar{\\theta}_{j} + \\overbar{\\beta}_{j+1}\\left(\\overbar{\\mathbb{M}}_{j+1} + \\overbar{b}_{j} + \\overbar{h}(\\overbar{\\theta}_{j})\\right),\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $\\overbar{\\mathbb{M}}_{j+1} \\triangleq \\theta_{j+1} - \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\theta_{j+1} \\vert \\overbar{\\mathcal{F}}_{j}\\right]$, $\\overbar{b}_{j} \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\theta_{j+1} \\vert \\overbar{\\mathcal{F}}_{j}\\right] - \\theta^{*}$ and $\\overbar{h}(x) \\triangleq \\theta^{*} - x$.\\\\\\\\\nHere we make the following observations:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item $\\overbar{b}_{j} \\rightarrow  0$ almost surely as $j \\rightarrow \\infty$. This follows from the hypothesis $\\overbar{\\beta}_{j} = o(\\beta_j)$ and by considering the fact that $\\theta_j \\rightarrow \\theta^{*}$ almost surely.\n\\item $\\overbar{h}$ is Lipschitz continuous.\n\\item $\\{\\overbar{\\mathbb{M}}_{j}\\}$ is a martingale difference sequence.\n\\item $\\{\\overbar{\\theta}_{j}\\}$ is stable, \\emph{i.e.}, $\\sup_{j}\\Vert \\overbar{\\theta}_{j} \\Vert < \\infty$.\n\\item The ODE defined by $\\dot{\\overbar{\\theta}}(t) = \\overbar{h}(\\overbar{\\theta}(t))$ is globally asymptotically stable at $\\theta^{*}$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nAll the above facts are easy to verify. Now by appealing to the third extension of Theorem $2$, Section $2.2$, Chapter $2$ of \\cite{borkar2008stochastic} and from the above observations, we can henceforth conclude that $\\overbar{\\theta}_{j} \\rightarrow \\theta^{*}$ almost surely as $j \\rightarrow \\infty$. This completes the proof of (\\ref{eq:thbarconv}).\n\\end{Proof}\n\\section{Experimental Illustrations}\nThe performance of our algorithm is evaluated on four different MDP settings:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\t\\item\n\tChain walk MDP.\n\t\\item\n\tLinearized cart-pole balancing.\n\t\\item\n\t$5$-link actuated pendulum balancing.\n\t\\item\n\tRandom MDP.\n\\end{enumerate} \nOur algorithm is compared against the state-of-the-art algorithms such as least squares policy iteration (LSPI), fast policy search method, model reference adaptive search (MRAS) and simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). In each setting, the results shown are averages over $10$ independent sample sequences generated by the algorithms  with different initial conditions. The function $\\varphi(\\cdot)$ used here is $\\varphi(x) = \\exp(rx)$, where $r \\in \\bbbr_{+}$. \n\\subsection{Experiment 1: Chain Walk}\nThis particular setting which has been proposed in \\cite{koller2000policy} demonstrates the unique scenario where policy iteration is non-convergent when approximate value functions are employed instead of true ones. This particular example is also utilized to empirically evaluate the performance of LSPI in \\cite{lagoudakis2003least}. Here, we compare the performance of our algorithm against LSPI and also against the stable Q-learning algorithm with linear function approximation (called Greedy-GQ) proposed in \\cite{maei2010toward}. This particular demonstration is pertinent in two ways: (1) when LSPI was evaluated on this setting, the maximum state space cardinality considered was $50$. We consider here a larger MDP with $450$ states and $(2)$ the stable Greedy-GQ algorithm is only evaluated over a small experimental setting in \\cite{maei2010toward}. Here, by applying it on a relatively harder setting, we attempt to assess its applicability and robustness.\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.34]{chainwalk}\n\t\\caption{Chain walk  MDP}\n\\end{figure}   \n\n\\vspace*{2mm}\n\\noindent\n\\textbf{Setup: }We consider a  Markov decision process with $\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert = 450$, $\\mathbb{A} = \\{L, R\\}$, $k_1=5$, $k_2=10$ and the discount factor $\\gamma = 0.99$.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Reward function: }\n$R(\\cdot, \\cdot, 150) = R(\\cdot, \\cdot, 300) = 1.0$ and zero for all other transitions.

We utilize $5$ RBFs for prediction and $10$ for policy features, \\emph{i.e.}, $k_1 = 5$ and $k_2 = 10$. Note that RBFs are Gaussian kernels which are parametrized by the centroid $m \\in \\bbbr$ and spread $v \\in \\bbbr_{+}$ and are expressed as:\n\\begin{equation}\nb(s) = e^{-\\frac{(s-m)^{2}}{2.0v^{2}}}.\n\\end{equation}\nIn our experiments, we initially tried to employ polynomials for features and found that the approximations they produced were quite poor. However, with RBFs one can indeed obtain decent performance by uniformly distributing the centroids in the state or state-action space and by considering the spread to be the half of the distance between subsequent centroids. In this way, one can indeed cover the respective spaces reasonably well. \nThe policy features and the prediction features are defined as follows:\\vspace*{3mm}\\\\\n\\noindent\n\\begin{minipage}{0.27\\textwidth}\n\t\\vspace*{0mm}\n\t%\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\t\\noindent\\rule{12cm}{1.0pt}\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\t%\\end{eqnarray*}\n\t\\hspace*{10mm}\\textbf{\\underline{Policy features}}\\vspace*{0mm}\\\\\n\t%\\noindent\\rule{12cm}{0.4pt}\\\\\n\t%\\scriptsize\n\t%The policy features $\\psi(s, a)$ are defined as, where\n\t\\noindent\n\t\\small\n\t\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\t\\psi(s,a) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\t\t\t\tI_{\\{a = L\\}}e^{-\\frac{(s-m_1)^{2}}{2.0v_{1}^{2}}}\\\\ \n\t\t\t\t\\vdots\\\\\n\t\t\t\tI_{\\{a = L\\}}e^{-\\frac{(s-m_5)^{2}}{2.0v_5^{2}}}\\\\\n\tI_{\\{a = R\\}}e^{-\\frac{(s-m_1)^{2}}{2.0v_1^{2}}}\\\\ \n\\vdots\\\\\nI_{\\{a = R\\}}e^{-\\frac{(s-m_5)^{2}}{2.0v_5^{2}}}\t\t\t\n\t\\end{pmatrix}.\n\t\\end{eqnarray*}\n\t\\null\n\t\\normalsize\n\t\\par\\xdef\\tpd{\\the\\prevdepth}\n\t\\vspace*{0mm}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\hspace*{2cm}\n\\begin{minipage}{0.48\\textwidth}\n\t\\vspace*{0mm}\n\t%\\fbox{\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth,keepaspectratio=true]{randmdpres}}\n\t%\\begin{equation*}\n\t\\vspace*{-12mm}\\vline height 100pt depth 50pt width 1pt\\vspace*{-54mm}\\hspace*{10mm}\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t&\\textbf{\\underline{Prediction features}}\\vspace*{10mm}\\\\\n\t&\\phi_{i}(s) = e^{-\\frac{(s-m_{i})^{2}}{2.0v_{i}^{2}}}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\t\\end{align*}\n\t%\\end{equation*}\n\\end{minipage}\\\\\nwhere $m_i = 5+10(i-1), v_i = 5$, $1 \\leq i \\leq 5$.\n\\normalsize\n\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Behaviour policy: } This is the most important choice and one has to be discreet while choosing the behaviour policy. For this setting, we prefer a policy which is unbiased and which uniformly covers the action space to provide sufficient exploration. Henceforth, by choosing $w_{b} = (0,0,\\dots,0)^{\\top}$ we obtain a uniform distribution over action space for every state in $\\mathbb{S}$.\\vspace*{2mm}\\\\\n\\textbf{Performance function:} Note that both LSPI and Q-learning seek in the policy parameter space to find the optimal or sub-optimal policy by recalibrating the parameter vector at each iteration in the direction of the improved value function. But the objective function  that we consider in this paper is a more generalized version involving the performance function $L$ and scalarization using $\\mathbb{E}_{\\nu_w}[\\cdot]$. So the predicament, the above algorithms attempt to resolve becomes a special instance of our generalized version and hence to compare our algorithm against them, we consider the objective function to be the weighted Euclidean norm of the approximate value function (with weight being the stationary distribution $\\nu_w$). Therefore, the performance function $L$ is defined as\n$L(h_{w \\vert w}) = h^{2}_{w \\vert w}$ (where squaring of the vector is defined as squaring of each of its components). Note that, in our algorithm, we approximate $h_{w \\vert w}$ using the behaviour policy and the true approximation and the stationary distribution involved are $\\Phi x_{w \\vert w_b}$ and $\\nu_{w_b}$ respectively. However, since the behaviour policy chosen is the uniform distribution over the action space for each state in $\\mathbb{S}$, one can easily deduce that the underlying Markov chain of the behaviour policy is a uniform random walk and its stationary distribution is the uniform distribution over the state space $\\mathbb{S}$. \n\\clearpage\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.32]{state-2-res-imp-crop}\n\t\\caption{The plot of the respective optimal value functions contrived by LSPI, Q-learning and Algorithm \\ref{alg:ce2-nd} for the chain walk MDP setting.

Our approach (Algorithm 2) literally surpassed other algorithms in terms of its quality.

The initial velocity\nof the cart and the angular velocity of the pendulum are 3.581 and 1.069 respectively. The goal is to find the optimal policy (which corresponds to the parameters of the horizontal force) to bring the cart to the equilibrium position, \\emph{i.e.}, cart at the centre of the track\nand the pendulum in the vertical position. The nature of the performance function $L$ in Equation (\\ref{eq:exp2perffunc}) is to explicitly capture this aspect of the problem, \\emph{i.e.}, to find the optimal policy that takes the cart from $s_{0}$ to the equilibrium \nposition and hence, only the cumulative cost incurred starting from $s_{0}$ is considered. Note that $s_{0}$ is chosen arbitrarily for the experiment and thus does not render any particular advantage to any of the algorithms.\n\\clearpage\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.45\\textwidth}\n\t\t\\fbox{\\includegraphics[width=52mm, height=44mm]{cart-crop}}\n\t\t\\subcaption{Cart-pole setup}\n\t\\end{subfigure}%\n\t\\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.55\\textwidth}\n\t\t\\vspace*{0mm}\\hspace*{0mm}\n\t\t\\fbox{\\includegraphics[width=62mm, height=44mm]{pendres2-crop}}\n\t\t\\subcaption{Cart-pole results}\n\t\\end{subfigure}\n\t\\caption{(a) The cart-pole system: The goal is to keep the pole in the  upright position and the cart at the centre of the track by applying a force $a$ either to the right or to the left.

The choice of the underlying behaviour policy indeed influenced this improved performance. Note that to labour high quality solutions, the choice of the behaviour policy is pivotal. In Experiment $1$, we considered a uniform policy, where every action is equally likely to be chosen for each state in $\\mathbb{S}$. \nThe results obtained in that experiment are quite promising, since, by only utilizing a uniform behaviour policy, we were able to grind out superior quality solutions. One has to justify the results to add credibility, considering the fact that LSPI is shown to produce optimal policy given a generative model.\nNote that in the original LSPI paper, we find that the LSPI method utilizes a sample trajectory provided in the form of tuples $\\{(s_i, a_i, r_i, s_i^{\\prime})\\}_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, where $s_i$ and $a_i$ are drawn uniformly randomly from $\\mathbb{S}$ and $\\mathbb{A}$ respectively, while $s_{i}^{\\prime}$ is the transitioned state given $s_i$ and $a_i$ by following the underlying transition dynamics of the MDP and  $r_i$ is the immediate reward for that transition.\nOne can immediately see that the information content required to generate such a trajectory is equivalent to that of maintaining a generative model. \n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.45\\textwidth}\n\t\\vspace{-30pt}\n\t%\\begin{center}\n\t\t% \\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t\t\\hspace*{-17mm}\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth, height=55mm]{trajlength}\n\t\t%\\vspace*{-20mm}\n\t\t%\\caption{Trajectory length used in Experiment 1}\n\t\t%   \\end{figure}\n\t%\\end{center}\n\t\\vspace{-40pt}\n\\end{wrapfigure}   \nFurther, in \\cite{lagoudakis2003least}, where LSPI is being empirically evaluated, we find that a trajectory length of $5000$ is being used in the $20$-state chain walk to obtain optimal performance. However, in our experiment (Experiment $1$) with $450$ states, we only consider a trajectory length of $5000$ for LSPI and hence obtain the sub-optimal performance. But, one should also consider the fact that the behaviour policy utilized by our algorithm in the same experiment is uniform (no prior information about the MDP is being  availed) and the trajectory length is only half of that of LSPI. Now, regarding the performance of Q-learning, we know (from Theorem $1$ of \\cite{maei2010toward}) that the method can only provide sub-optimal solutions.  \n\n In Experiments $2$, $3$ and $4$, we surmised the behaviour policy based on more than a passable knowledge of the MDP.  To make the comparison unbiased (since our algorithm utilized prior information about the MDP to induce the behaviour policy), in the algorithms (MRAS, fast policy search and SPSA) to which our method is being compared, we employed the more accurate on-policy approximation which requires the generative model. This is contrary to our method, where off-policy approximation is tried. Our algorithm  exhibited as good a performance as the state-of-the-art methods in the cart-pole experiment and noticeably the finest performance in the actuated pendulum experiment. This is regardless of the fact that our algorithm is primarily designed for the discrete, finite MDP setting, while the cart-pole experiment and the actuated pendulum experiment are MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. The suboptimal performance of the fast policy search and MRAS is primarily attributed to the insufficient sample size. But the underlying computing machine which we consider for the experiments is a $64$-bit Intel i$3$ processor with $4$GB of memory. Because of these limited resources, there is a finite limit to which the sample size can be scaled. This illustrates the effectiveness of our approach on a resource restricted setting. Now regarding the random MDP experiment, the performance of our algorithm is on par (in fact superior) to the state-of-the-art schemes.\\vspace*{4mm}\\\\ \n($2$) The significance of these results is further strengthened by the fact that all the baseline algorithms considered in the experiments have access to the generative-model and the outcome depicted above is obtained after processing a bevy of sample trajectories. This is contrary to our method where such a privilege is not conferred.\\vspace*{5mm}\\\\\n($3$) The algorithm does not seem to be heavily dependent on the discount factor $\\gamma$. To corroborate the claim, we show here the performance of the algorithm for two different, yet extreme values of $\\gamma$, \\emph{i.e.}, for $\\gamma \\in \\{0.01, 0.99\\}$ on the chain walk MDP with $60$ states. Here, only the transitions to states $20$ and $40$ incur a positive cost, while the rest are null transitions. The optimal policies generated by our algorithm in the two cases are shown in Figs. \\ref{fig:resgamma01} and  \\ref{fig:resgamma99} respectively. As one can observe, for $\\gamma = 0.99$, the window around state $20$ is wider than that for $\\gamma = 0.01$. This is the expected behaviour since the discount factor controls the relative weights of future transitions while evaluating the discounted value function. However, note that this is not the case with regards to state $40$. This lack of accuracy in the final third primarily due to the fact that the behaviour policy we consider in this setting has its stationary distribution heavily concentrated on the first half of the state space. This particular scenario thus also illustrates the dependency of behaviour policy on the accuracy of the solution generated by our algorithm. This is indeed revealed in Theorem \\ref{thm:main}. To exemplify it further, we show here how the relative frequency of the states in the given trajectory generated using the behaviour policy determines the accuracy of the solution of our algorithm. Remember that the relative frequency of the states in the sample trajectory is indeed decided by the stationary distribution of the Markov chain induced by the behaviour policy. The results are shown in Figs. \\ref{fig:rfreqleft} and \\ref{fig:rfreqright}.\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{res_gamma_01}\n\t\\caption{The schematic diagram of the optimal policy generated by Algorithm $2$ for the chain walk MDP with $\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert = 60$, $\\mathbb{A} = \\{L, R\\}$ and the discount factor $\\gamma = 0.01$.}\\label{fig:resgamma01}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[scale=0.27]{res_gamma_99}\n\t\\caption{The schematic diagram of the optimal policy generated by Algorithm $2$ for the chain walk MDP with $\\vert \\mathbb{S} \\vert = 60$, $\\mathbb{A} = \\{L, R\\}$ and the discount factor $\\gamma = 0.99$.}\\label{fig:resgamma99}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t\\begin{subfigure}{0.4\\textwidth}\n\t\\vspace*{5mm}\\includegraphics[height=45mm, width=44mm]{leftfreqvalues-crop}\n\t\\subcaption{Frequency ratio of the states in the sample trajectory}\n\\end{subfigure}\\hspace*{1mm}\n\t\\begin{subfigure}{0.6\\textwidth}\n\t\\includegraphics[height=45mm, width=70mm]{leftfreq-crop}\n\t\\subcaption{Optimal value function generated by Algorithm $2$}\n\\end{subfigure}\n\\caption{The frequency ratio of a particular state in the sample trajectory is defined as the ratio of the number of occurrences of that state in the sample trajectory to the total number of state transitions in the sample trajectory.

The other parameters required minimum tuning with almost all of them taking common values.\n%\\clearpage\n\\subsection{Data efficiency}\nHere, we compare the efficiency of our algorithm with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithms. To measure the efficiency, we consider two benchmarks: \\textit{system configuration count} and \\textit{memory usage}. The system configuration count denotes the number of times the algorithm queries the generative model of the MDP with a policy to obtain sample trajectories. Memory usage denotes the average real time memory consumed by the algorithms. The results are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:effcomp}. The performance of our algorithm with regard to the above benchmarks is commendable.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t%\\begin{framed}\n\t\\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.5\\textwidth}\n\t    \\fbox{\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth, height=44mm]{confusage2}}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n    \\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.5\\textwidth}\n        \\fbox{\\includegraphics[width=0.93\\textwidth, height=44mm]{memusagectrl2}}\n    \\end{subfigure}\n    \\caption{Efficiency comparison of Algorithm $2$ \\emph{w.r.t.} the state-of-the-art methods.}\\label{fig:effcomp}\n    %\\end{framed}\n\\end{figure}\nWe also compare here the average memory usage of the fast policy search algorithm and our algorithm with respect to $k_2$ which is the dimension of the policy space. The results are shown in Fig. \\ref{fig:k2vsmem}. The illustration shows that memory usage of our algorithms almost remains constant, however fast policy search is very sensitive to the parameter $k_2$. \n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\\textwidth}\n\t\\vspace{-20pt}\n\t\\begin{center}\n\t\t% \\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t\t\\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth, height=55mm]{memvsk2}\n\t\t%   \\end{figure}\n\t\\end{center}\n\t\\vspace{-40pt}\n\t\\caption{Memory usage \\emph{w.r.t.} $k_2$}\\label{fig:k2vsmem}\n\t\\vspace{-10pt}\n\\end{wrapfigure}   \nThis non-dependency of our algorithm on the dimension of the policy space has a real pragmatic advantage since, as a result of this, our algorithm can be applied to very large and complex MDPs with wider policy spaces where fast policy search and MRAS might become intractable.\n\nAnother advantage of our approach is the application on legacy systems. In such systems, the information on the dynamics of the system in the form of bits or bytes or paper might be hard to find. However, human experience through long time interaction with the system is available in most cases. Utilizing this human experience to develop a generative model of the system might be hard, however using it to find a behaviour policy which can give average performance is more plausible, and which in turn can be exploited using our algorithm to find an optimal policy.\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe presented an algorithm which solves the modified control problem in a model free MDP setting. We showed its convergence to the global optimal policy relative to the choice of the behaviour policy. The algorithm is data efficient, robust, stable as well as computationally and storage efficient. Using an appropriately chosen behaviour policy, it is also seen to consistently outperform or is competitive against the current state-of-the-art (both) off-policy and on-policy methods.\n\n\n%\\begin{acknowledgements}\n%If you\'d like to thank anyone, place your comments here\n%and remove the percent signs.\n%\\end{acknowledgements}\n\n% BibTeX users please use one of\n%\\bibliographystyle{spbasic}      % basic style, author-year citations\n\\bibliographystyle{spmpsci}      % mathematics and physical sciences\n%\\bibliographystyle{spphys}       % APS-like style for physics\n%\\bibliography{}   % name your BibTeX data base\n\n% Non-BibTeX users please use\n%\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\\bibliography{mljrnlbib}\n%\n% and use \\bibitem to create references.

We show that the heat current in the dual Lifshitz theory involves the energy flux, which is an irrelevant operator for $z>1$. The linearized fluctuations relevant for computing the thermoelectric conductivities turn on a source for this irrelevant operator, leading to several novel and non-trivial aspects in the holographic renormalization procedure and the identification of the physical observables in the dual theory. Moreover, imposing Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the spatial components of one of the two Maxwell fields present leads to different thermoelectric conductivities. Dirichlet boundary conditions reproduce the thermoelectric DC conductivities obtained from the near horizon analysis of Donos and Gauntlett, while Neumann boundary conditions result in a new set of DC conductivities. We make preliminary analytical estimates for the temperature behavior of the thermoelectric matrix in appropriate regions of parameter space. In particular, at large temperatures we find that the only case which could lead to a linear resistivity $\\rho \\sim T$ corresponds to $z=4/3$.   \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\end{titlepage}\n\n%\\pagestyle{empty}\n%\\setcounter{footnote}{0}\n\n\t\n\\tableofcontents\n\\addtocontents{toc}{\\protect\\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}}\n\\renewcommand{\\theequation}{\\arabic{section}.\\arabic{equation}}\n%\\setcounter{page}{1} \\pagestyle{plain}\n\t\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\t\n\\newpage\n\\section{Introduction and summary of results}\n%\\label{}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nRecent years have seen growing efforts to extend the dictionary of holography beyond the original paradigm of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and generalize it to spacetimes with different asymptotics from those of AdS. In particular, there has been interest in extensions to quantum field theories that may not be relativistic in the UV, with Lifshitz theories providing a prime example \\cite{Kachru:2008yh,Taylor:2008tg,Ross:2009ar,Ross:2011gu,Mann:2011hg,Baggio:2011cp,Griffin:2011xs,Griffin:2012qx,Chemissany:2014xsa}. These efforts are part of a broader program to enlarge the universality class of theories to which holographic techniques can be applied, and also to understand how symmetries and symmetry breaking mechanisms are encoded in a spacetime description. Much of this program has been motivated by the intriguing behavior of many novel, strongly correlated quantum phases of matter that typically lack a quasiparticle description, but are amenable to being probed with the tools of holography. Indeed, the latter can offer a new analytical window into the dynamics of such phases, and provide insight into their unconventional transport behavior. For a comprehensive review with a focus on condensed matter applications see \\emph{e.g.}, \\cite{Hartnoll:2016apf}.\n\n\nThus far, most holographic studies of transport have been framed within the context of systems\nwhich break Lorentz invariance in the IR, but emanate from a relativistic conformal fixed point in the UV. Such constructions, which rely on geometries that approach AdS at the boundary, have proven fruitful for probing a rich variety of IR phases, whose behavior is captured by the near-horizon region of the geometry. However, non-relativistic UV fixed points and their hyperscaling violating generalizations are interesting in their own right, and furthermore broaden the class of renormalization group (RG) flows that can be modeled holographically, offering novel ways to make contact with condensed matter systems. In particular, in order to identify the physical observables in non-relativistic theories holographically it is necessary to place them at the UV of the RG flow, that is to consider bulk backgrounds that are asymptotically non-relativistic, and develop the corresponding holographic dictionary.   \n\n%%\nTo this end, in this paper we examine a four dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Axion-Dilaton theory that admits a class of non-relativistic geometries that are asymptotically Lifshitz and exhibit hyperscaling violation. They are parametrized by a dynamical critical exponent $z$ and a hyperscaling violating parameter $\\theta$, which characterizes the anomalous scaling of the free energy of the system. The axionic fields included in the model break translational invariance along the boundary directions, thus providing a mechanism to dissipate momentum \\cite{Karch:2007pd,Hartnoll:2009ns,Faulkner:2010zz,Faulkner:2013bna}, a crucial ingredient for a realistic description of materials with impurities and an underlying lattice structure. The theory we focus on involves two massless $U(1)$ gauge fields, one responsible for the Lifshitz-like nature of the background solutions, while the other is analogous to a standard Maxwell field in asymptotically-AdS charged black holes.\n\n\nThe electrical DC conductivity matrix for this model was computed originally\nin \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj}, using the near horizon analysis of \\cite{Donos:2014cya}. Subsequently, \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr} computed the full thermoelectric conductivity matrix in the presence of a background magnetic field, using the same near horizon analysis.\\footnote{See also \\cite{Ge:2016lyn,Chen:2017gsl}. Note, however, that there are a number of subtleties in their analysis, including choices of parameters which lead to violations of the null energy condition. Some of their results differ from ours.} \nHowever, the near horizon analysis does not suffice to identify the conserved currents in the dual Lifshitz theory whose two-point functions determine the thermoelectric conductivities. Moreover, both the identification of the conserved currents in the Lifshitz theory and the corresponding conductivities depend on the boundary conditions for the bulk fields imposed at infinity. In particular, the conductivities obtained from the near horizon analysis correspond only to one specific boundary condition, out of an infinite family of possible boundary conditions.   \n\nIn this paper we consider linearized fluctuations around a class of purely electric asymptotically hyperscaling violating Lifshitz backgrounds with axion charge that turn on all the modes necessary to obtain the full matrix of thermoelectric conductivities. Through a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at the UV we determine the boundary counterterms necessary to renormalize the theory and identify the physical observables in the dual Lifshitz theory. One of our main observations is that the fluctuations necessary to compute the thermoelectric conductivities turn on a source for the energy flux, which is an irrelevant operator in the energy-momentum complex of the dual Lifshitz theory \\cite{Ross:2011gu}. This leads to several subtleties in the holographic renormalization of the theory, which we address in detail. Moreover, we consider both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for the gauge field supporting the Lifshitz background and show that these boundary conditions result in a different set of thermoelectric conductivities for the second Maxwell field. In fact, there is an infinite set of possible boundary conditions, parameterized by $SL(2,\\bb Z)$ \\cite{Witten:2003ya}, all leading to a different set of conductivities. Only the conductivities corresponding to Dirichlet boundary conditions on the gauge field supporting the Lifshitz background match those obtained from the near horizon analysis, which has mostly been used in the literature. However, we show that boundary conditions at the UV provide a mechanism for obtaining different conductivities from the same bulk theory.     \n\nThe conductivities we obtain from Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions have a rich but distinct behavior as a function of temperature and are sensitive to the various parameters characterizing the background solution. We perform a preliminary analysis of their temperature dependence by looking for regions in the parameter space where they exhibit approximate scaling behavior with the temperature. We identify several clean scaling regimes in the limit of large temperature, which in our setup probes the Lifshitz theory in the UV. Rather intriguingly, the only case we could identify that can potentially lead to a linear resistivity arises in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions for the specific value $z=4/3$ of the dynamical exponent, which was also singled out in the field theory analysis of \\cite{Hartnoll:2015sea}.  \n\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section \\ref{sec:model} we present the general class of models we are interested in, both in the Einstein and the so called `dual frame' \\cite{Kanitscheider:2009as}, as well as the generic backgrounds around which we linearize the equations of motion. We consider backgrounds carrying only electric Maxwell charge and magnetic axion charge in order to incorporate momentum dissipation. A significant part of our analysis is carried out for generic backgrounds and applies to a wide range of UV asymptotics, including AdS$_4$ and hyperscaling violating Lifshitz with arbitrary dynamical exponents. A specific exact asymptotically hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black brane solution studied in \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj} is reviewed in subsection \\ref{example} and is the focus of most of our subsequent analysis. Section \\ref{sec:linear} contains our study of the linearized fluctuation equations, which are collected in appendix \\ref{sec:fluctuations}. In particular, we obtain the general solution of the fluctuation equations in the small frequency limit and with infalling boundary conditions on the horizon. Specializing to the exact background of subsection \\ref{example}, we then obtain the asymptotic UV expansions of the linear fluctuations and determine the boundary terms required in order to renormalize the theory. Finally, we identify the physical observables in the dual Lifshitz theory for two different boundary conditions on the bulk gauge field supporting the Lifshitz background. All two-point functions captured by the linear fluctuations we consider are presented in section \\ref{sec:conductivities}, and the corresponding DC conductivities are obtained after the identification of the thermal current in the dual Lifshitz theory. We conclude in section \\ref{sec:conclusion}, where we also discuss a number of possible directions for future work. The radial Hamiltonian description of the bulk dynamics, which is used to renormalize the theory, is summarized in appendix \\ref{ham}.\n\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Hyperscaling violating Lifshitz black branes with axion charge}\n\\label{sec:model}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nWe are interested in asymptotically hyperscaling violating Lifshitz backgrounds supported by a massless gauge field and a running dilaton \\cite{Taylor:2008tg}.

The summation convention is adopted for the indices $a$ and $I, J$, in addition to the spacetime indices $\\m, \\n$. Finally, the symmetric matrix $\\S_{IJ}(\\f)$ and the functions $Z(\\f)$ and $V(\\f)$ are going to be kept generic for most part of our analysis, except that $\\S_{IJ}(\\f)$ is required to be invertible with strictly positive eigenvalues. \n\nThe equations of motion following from the action \\eqref{action-0} are\n\\bal\\label{eoms-0}\n&R_{\\m\\n}=Z(\\f)\\pa_\\m\\c^a\\pa_\\n\\c^a+\\a\\pa_\\m\\f\\pa_\\n\\f+\\frac{1}{d_s}V(\\f)g_{\\m\\n}+2\\S_{IJ}(\\f)\\(F_{\\m\\r}^I F^J_\\n{}^\\r-\\frac{1}{2d_s}F^I_{\\r\\s}F^{J\\r\\s}g_{\\m\\n}\\),\\NO\\\\\n&\\nabla^\\m(Z(\\f)\\pa_\\m\\c^a)=0,\\qquad 2\\a\\square\\f-V'(\\f)=\\S'_{IJ}(\\f)F^I_{\\r\\s}F^{J\\r\\s},\\qquad \\nabla^\\m(\\S_{IJ}(\\f)F^J_{\\m\\n})=0.\n\\eal\n\n\n\\paragraph{Dual frame} As for non-conformal branes \\cite{Kanitscheider:2009as}, the holographic dictionary for asymptotically hyperscaling violating Lifshitz backgrounds is best understood in the so called `dual frame' \\cite{Chemissany:2014xsa}, obtained by a Weyl rescaling of the Einstein frame metric as  \n\\be\\label{dual-metric}\n\\lbar g_{\\m\\n}=e^{-2\\x\\f}g_{\\m\\n},\n\\ee\nwhere the parameter $\\x$ is proportional to the hyperscaling violating exponent $\\th$ (see eq.~\\eqref{xi-theta}).

In the analysis that follows we will use both the Einstein and dual frame variables, depending on which frame is more convenient for different aspects of the analysis. \n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{Anisotropic black brane solutions}\n%\\label{sec:background}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nDepending on the choice of the functions $Z(\\f)$, $\\S_{IJ}(\\f)$ and $V(\\f)$, the action \\eqref{action-0} admits a wide range of planar solutions, including black holes and domain walls at finite charge density. Such solutions can be asymptotically AdS, conformal to AdS, Lifshitz, or hyperscaling violating Lifshitz.

As a consequence, the Einstein frame metric possesses a well defined conformal boundary for $\\th<0$, but for $\\th>0$ there is a curvature singularity at $\\bar r\\to \\infty$. In contrast, the dual frame metric \\eqref{dual-metric-background} is independent of the hyperscaling exponent $\\th$ and, hence, possesses a well defined conformal boundary for all $\\th$. Since hyperscaling violating Lifshitz backgrounds necessarily involve a running dilaton that diverges at the UV, it was argued in \\cite{Chemissany:2014xsa} that the presence of a metric curvature singularity is a frame-dependent property that can be avoided simply by going to the dual frame. Instead of discarding the case $\\th>0$, therefore, we postulate that the holographic dictionary for all values of $\\th$ should be constructed in the {\\em dual frame}.     \n\n\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{An exact black brane solution}\n\\label{example}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nAn exact asymptotically hyperscaling violating black brane solution of \\eqref{BEOM} with non-zero axion charge was presented in \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj} (see also \\cite{Ge:2016lyn,Bhatnagar:2017twr}) for the case $d_s=2$ and generic exponents $z$ and $\\th$, subject to a number of conditions that we will specify shortly. This solution exists when the expressions \\eqref{asym-potentials} hold exactly, instead of merely asymptotically near the UV. \nSpecifically, the Lagrangian that admits the solutions found in \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj} corresponds to the choice of functions\n\\bal\\label{asym-potentials-exact}\n&V(\\f)=-(2+z-\\th)(1+z-\\th)e^{\\th\\f/\\m},\\qquad \\S_{11}(\\f)=\\frac14 e^{(\\th-4)\\f/\\m},\\NO\\\\\n&\\S_{12}(\\f)=\\S_{21}(\\f)=0,\\qquad \\S_{22}(\\f)=\\frac14 e^{(2z-2-\\th)\\f/\\m},\\qquad Z(\\f)=\\frac12e^{\\frac{\\m}{\\th-2}\\f},\n\\eal\nwith the normalization of the dilaton kinetic term in \\eqref{action-0} chosen such that $\\a=1/2$. The exact black brane solution discussed in \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj,Bhatnagar:2017twr} then takes the form\\footnote{Note the change of notation relative to \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj}:\n\t$r\\to v$, $\\th\\to -\\th$, $\\g\\to\\m$, $f\\to\\cf$, $\\a\\to p$ and $Q_I\\to 4{\\rm sgn}(\\th) q_I$.}\n\\bal\n\\label{HVbackground}\n&ds^2 = v^{-\\th} \\left( - v^{2z} \\cf(v) dt^2 + \\frac{dv^2}{\\cf(v) v^2} + v^2 d\\vec{x}^2 \\right),\\quad \\phi = \\m \\log v, \\quad \\chi^a = p \\, x^a,\\NO\\\\\n&a^1= \\frac{4{\\rm sgn}(\\th)q_1}{2+z-\\th}(v^{2+z-\\th}-v^{2+z-\\th}_h),\\quad a^2 = \\frac{4{\\rm sgn}(\\th)q_2}{\\th-z}(v^{\\th-z}-v^{\\th-z}_h), \n\\eal\nwhere the axion charge $p$ denotes the amount of momentum dissipation in the dual system and\n\\be\nq_1=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{(2+z-\\th)(z-1)}{8}}\\;.\n\\ee\n$v_h$ denotes the location of the horizon and corresponds to the largest real root of the equation $\\cf(v)=0$, where the blackening factor is given by\n\\be\\label{blackening-sol}\n\\cf(v)=1+\\frac{p^2}{(2-\\th)(z-2)v^{2z-\\th}}-\\frac{m}{v^{2+z-\\th}}+\\frac{8q_2^2}{(2-\\th)(z-\\th)v^{2(z+1-\\th)}}.\n\\ee\nAlthough this expression for the blackening factor holds provided $z\\neq 2$, $\\th\\neq 2$ and $\\th\\neq z$, the solution can be extended to these cases by including certain logarithmic terms. For example, the blackening factor for the case $z=2$, $\\th\\neq z$ is given in \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj}. The radial coordinate $v$ in \\eqref{HVbackground} is related to the radial coordinates, $r$, defined in \\eqref{Bans}, $\\bar r$, defined in \\eqref{def-bar-r}, and $u$ defined in \\eqref{def-u} through the identities \n\\be\\label{coords}\\boxed{\n\tdr=-{\\rm sgn}(\\th)v^{-\\th/2}\\cf^{-1/2}(v)\\frac{dv}{v},\\qquad d\\bar r=\\cf^{-1/2}(v)\\frac{dv}{v},\\qquad du={\\rm sgn}(\\th)v^{z-3}dv.}\n\\ee\nIn particular, the coordinate $v$ is asymptotically related to the canonical radial coordinate in the dual frame as \n$v\\sim e^{\\bar r}$ for all values of $\\th$. All of these coordinates are useful for different aspects of the subsequent analysis.\n\n\nIn order for the solution \\eqref{HVbackground} to be asymptotically hyperscaling violating Lifshitz with exponents $z$ and $\\th$, the blackening factor $\\cf(v)$ must asymptote to 1 as $v\\to\\infty$. For $q_2\\neq 0$ and $p\\neq 0$, together with the NEC, this requires that $z\\geq 1$ and $\\th<z+1$. Moreover, the axion charge $p$ is a magnetic charge that corresponds to a non-normalizable mode and should be kept fixed for all solutions of the theory, while the mass $m$ and the electric charge $q_2$ correspond to normalizable modes, i.e. to state-dependent parameters. We therefore demand that the term proportional to $p^2$ is asymptotically dominant relative to the terms involving $m$ and $q_2$, which further restricts the values of the dynamical exponents to\n\\be\\label{exponents}\\boxed{\n1\\leq z <2,\\qquad \\th<z.}\n\\ee\nDemanding that the exponents $z$ and $\\th$ satisfy \\eqref{exponents} ensures that the terms in \\eqref{blackening-sol} are increasingly asymptotically subleading in the order they are written, from left to right. Note that the upper bounds in these inequalities can be saturated, but we will not consider these cases here since the form of the blackening factor \\eqref{blackening-sol} would acquire logarithmic terms, which must be analyzed separately. It is important to emphasize that the conditions \\eqref{exponents} are {\\em not} a generic requirement for hyperscaling violating backgrounds, but rather a specific feature of the solution \\eqref{HVbackground}.\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\section{Linear fluctuations and the holographic dictionary}\n\\label{sec:linear}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\nIn order to compute the conductivities for hyperscaling violating Lifshitz backgrounds of the form \\eqref{Bans} it is necessary to not only solve the system of linearized field equations around such backgrounds, but also to correctly identify the holographic observables, i.e. the sources and the local operators, in the dual theory. As we will see in the subsequent analysis, identifying the holographic observables in such theories is far from trivial and requires a novel form of holographic renormalization.     \n\nIn appendix \\ref{sec:fluctuations} we derive the linearized equations for a consistent set of spatially homogeneous, time dependent fluctuations around a generic background of the form \\eqref{Bans} for the special case $d_s=2$, i.e. four dimensional bulk. The system of equations we derive can be used to compute certain two-point functions at arbitrary frequency and in any background of the form \\eqref{Bans}, including asymptotically AdS$_4$ backgrounds. However, in this section we focus exclusively on the zero frequency limit of the fluctuations around the hyperscaling violating Lifshitz background \\eqref{HVbackground}.  \n\nWithout loss of generality, we consider fluctuations that preserve the Einstein frame gauge\n\\be\nds^2=dr^2+\\g_{ij}(r,t)dx^idx^j,\\qquad A_r^I=0,\n\\ee\nwhere $x^i=\\{t,x^a\\}$, and we parameterize the fluctuations as\n\\be\\label{fluctuations}\n\\g_{ij}=\\g_{Bij}+h_{ij},\\quad \nA_i^I=A_{Bi}^I+\\frak a_i^I, \\quad\n\\f=\\f_B+\\vf,\\quad\n\\c^a=\\c_B^a+\\t^a.\n\\ee\nDefining $S_i^j\\equiv\\g_B^{jk}h_{ki}$, the linearized equations allow one to consistently set $S_t^{t}=S_x^x=S_y^y=S_x^y=\\vf=\\frak a_t=0$ and to consider only the non-zero components $\\frak a_a^I=\\frak a_a^I(r,t)$, $S_t^a=S_t^a(r,t)$, and $\\t^a(r,t)$. The resulting system of linear equations can be reduced to the coupled system of equations \\eqref{fluctuation-eqs}, involving only the variables $\\frak a^I_a$ and \n\\be\\label{Theta}\n\\Th^a\\equiv S^a_t-\\frac{i\\o}{p} \\t^a,\n\\ee\nwhere $\\o$ is the frequency.

These solutions apply to any background of the form \\eqref{Bans} and can therefore be used to compute the DC conductivities in a large class of holographic theories with momentum dissipation. However, identifying the operators whose two-point functions these fluctuations compute is a very non-trivial question that requires a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the solutions at the UV, which depends strongly on the specific choice of background.     \n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{Asymptotic analysis at the UV}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nIn our analysis of the linear fluctuations so far we have not specified the background other than demanding that it takes the generic form \\eqref{Bans}. The asymptotic analysis in the UV, however, and the holographic dictionary, are sensitive to the asymptotic form of the background. We are therefore compelled at this point to make a concrete choice. Ideally, one would like to have general expressions for the DC conductivities valid for any asymptotically hyperscaling violating Lifshitz background described in section \\ref{hvLf-backgrounds}. However, even though they are not directly involved in supporting the asymptotic form of the background to leading order, additional matter fields and their asymptotic behavior do in general affect the form of the UV expansions of the fluctuations, and consequently the holographic dictionary. We already encountered an example of the effect extra matter fields can have on the asymptotics in section \\ref{example}, where we saw that in order for the exact background \\eqref{HVbackground} to have a well defined asymptotic behavior in the UV, the dynamical exponents must lie in the range \\eqref{exponents}, which is more stringent than the conditions imposed by the null energy condition.     \n\nIn the subsequent analysis, therefore, we consider fluctuations around the specific exact background \\eqref{HVbackground}. In particular, we set the functions that specify the bulk Lagrangian as in \\eqref{asym-potentials-exact} and we assume that the dynamical exponents satisfy \\eqref{exponents}, although we exclude the relativistic case $z=1$, since it requires a separate analysis. Moreover, we use the radial coordinate $v$ for the asymptotic analysis, since this is the natural coordinate for the exact background \\eqref{HVbackground} and also it is simply related asymptotically to the canonical radial coordinate $\\bar r$ in the dual frame. Crucially, the UV is located at $v\\to\\infty$ independently of the value of the hyperscaling violation exponent $\\th$. In terms of $v$, the functions \\eqref{asym-potentials-exact} evaluated on the background \\eqref{HVbackground} take the form   \n\\be\\label{model-functions-v}\n\\S_{11}(\\f_B)=\\frac14 v^{\\th-4},\\qquad \\S_{22}(\\f_B)=\\frac14 v^{2z-2-\\th},\\qquad Z(\\f_B)=\\frac12v^{-(2z-2-\\th)},\n\\ee\nwhile a comparison between \\eqref{HVbackground} and the general background ansatz \\eqref{Bans} allows us to read off \n\\be\ne^{2A}=v^{2-\\th},\\qquad f=v^{2(z-1)}\\cf(v).\n\\ee\n\nTo determine the UV asymptotic expansions of the linear fluctuations \\eqref{theta-sol} and \\eqref{a-sol} it is useful to introduce the functions \n\\be\n\\J(u)=\\int_{u_*}^u \\frac{du'}{e^{2A(u')}f(u')^{2}},\\qquad \\cy^I(u)=\\int_{u^*}^u \\frac{du'a^I(u')}{e^{2A(u')}f(u')^{2}},\n\\ee\nwhich in terms of the radial coordinate $v$ become\n\\bsub\n\\label{aux}\n\\bal\n\\J(v)=&\\;{\\rm sgn}(\\th)\\int^v dv\\; v^{\\th-3z-1}\\cf^{-2}(v),\\\\\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\cy^1(v)=&\\;\\frac{4{\\rm sgn}(\\th)q_1}{2+z-\\th}\\Big(-v_h^{2+z-\\th}\\J(v)+{\\rm sgn}(\\th)\\int^v dv\\; v^{-2z+1}\\cf^{-2}(v)\\Big),\\\\\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\cy^2(v)=&\\;\\frac{4{\\rm sgn}(\\th)q_2}{\\th-z}\\Big(-v_h^{\\th-z}\\J(v)+{\\rm sgn}(\\th)\\int^v dv\\; v^{2\\th-4z-1}\\cf^{-2}(v)\\Big).\n\\eal\n\\esub\nThe small frequency solutions of the fluctuation equations, \\eqref{theta-sol} and \\eqref{a-sol}, can then be expressed in the $v$ coordinate in the compact form  \n\\bsub\n\\label{sols-v}\n\\bal\n\\Th^{a(0)}(v,\\o)=&\\;v^{2(z-1)}\\cf(v)\\Big(\\Th_{1}^{a}(\\o)+\\Th_{2}^{a}(\\o)\\J(v)+4c^a_I(\\o)\\cy^I(v)\\Big),\\\\\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\rule{0cm}{1.cm}\\frak a^{I(0)}_a(v,\\o)=&\\;\\frak a^I_{oa}(\\o)-\\Th_{1}^{a}(\\o)a^I(v)-{\\rm sgn}(\\th)q_J\\Th_{2}^{a}(\\o)\\int^v  dv\\; \\S^{IJ}v^{z-3}\\J(v)\\NO\\\\\n&-{\\rm sgn}(\\th)\\int^v dv\\;\\S^{IJ}v^{-(z+1)}\\(\\cf^{-1}(v)\\d^K_J+4q_J v^{2(z-1)}\\cy^K(v)\\)c^a_K(\\o).\n\\eal\n\\esub\nThese expressions, together with \\eqref{aux}, allow us to straightforwardly determine the UV asymptotic expansions of the fluctuations.\n\n\\paragraph{UV expansions} Using the expression \\eqref{blackening-sol} for the function $\\cf(v)$, as well as the allowed range \\eqref{exponents} for the dynamical exponents, the integral expressions in \\eqref{aux} determine that asymptotically\n\\bsub\n\\label{uv-exp-aux}\n\\bal\n\\J(v)=&\\;{\\rm sgn}(\\th)\\Big(\\frac{v^{\\th-3z}}{\\th-3z}+\\cdots\\Big),\\\\\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\rule{0cm}{1.cm}\\cy^1(v)=&\\;\\frac{-4q_1}{2+z-\\th}\\Big(\\frac{v^{-2(z-1)}}{2(z-1)}+\\frac{2p^2v^{\\th+2-4z}}{(2-\\th)(z-2)(\\th-4z+2)}-\\frac{(2m-v_h^{2+z-\\th})v^{\\th-3z}}{\\th-3z}+\\cdots\\Big),\\\\\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\rule{0cm}{1.cm}\\cy^2(v)=&\\;\\frac{4q_2}{\\th-z}\\Big(-\\frac{v_h^{\\th-z}v^{\\th-3z}}{\\th-3z}+\\cdots\\Big),\n\\eal\n\\esub\nwhere the ellipses stand for subleading terms that are not required for the holographic calculation of the conductivities.

However, in order to extract this information it is necessary to properly identify the local operators and their sources in the dual hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theory, which is the goal of the next subsection.     \n\n \n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\subsection{Renormalized holographic observables and Ward identities}\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\\label{dictionary}\n\nIn order to construct the holographic dictionary one must determine a canonical set of symplectic data that parameterize the space of asymptotic solutions \\cite{Papadimitriou:2010as}. This symplectic space is then holographically identified with the space of local sources and operators in the dual quantum field theory. As we pointed out in section \\ref{hvLf-backgrounds}, a well defined space of asymptotic hyperscaling violating Lifshitz solutions exists for both positive and negative values of the hyperscaling violation exponent $\\th$ only in the dual frame, defined by the Weyl transformation \\eqref{dual-metric}, where the parameter $\\x$ is related to $\\th$ as in eq.~\\eqref{xi-theta}. Moreover, a natural basis of symplectic variables that can be used to parameterize the space of asymptotic solutions is provided by the set of generalized coordinates and canonical momenta in the radial Hamiltonian formulation of the bulk dynamics, summarized in appendix \\ref{ham}.     \n\nOur first goal in this section, therefore, is to determine the asymptotic expansions of all canonical variables in the dual frame in terms of the modes in the solutions of the linear fluctuations equations. Since we do not consider fluctuations of the dilaton, the relation between the linear fluctuations of the fields in the Einstein and dual frames is straightforward. In particular, the asymptotic expansions of the linear fluctuations in \\eqref{uv-exp} apply to both the Einstein and dual frames. The relation between the canonical momenta in the two frames is less trivial, but also straightforward.

The covariant fluctuations and their conjugate momenta provide the correct symplectic variables that should be identified with the local sources and operators in the dual theory, but they depend on the radial coordinate, while the sources and operators in the dual theory should be solely expressed in terms of the radially independent modes $\\Th_1^a(\\o)$, $\\Th_2^a(\\o)$, $\\frak a_{oa}^I(\\o)$, $c_I^a(\\o)$ and $\\t_o^a(\\o)$ parameterizing the solutions of the linearized equations. The resolution to this problem is provided by a suitable canonical transformation that diagonalizes the symplectic map between the canonical variables and the modes parameterizing the solutions of the linearized equations. This procedure is a generalization of the method of holographic renormalization that can be applied to a wider class of backgrounds, beyond asymptotically AdS ones \\cite{Papadimitriou:2010as}. \n\nAs we will see below, the fluctuations we have turned on contain a non-zero source, namely $\\Th_1^a(\\o)$, for the energy flux, which is an irrelevant operator in the dual Lifshitz theory \\cite{Ross:2011gu}. As a result, the canonical transformation required to renormalize the asymptotically hyperscaling violating theory we consider here is qualitatively different from the usual canonical transformations that implement holographic renormalization in asymptotically AdS backgrounds or asymptotically Lifshitz backgrounds without a source for the energy flux. However, it shares some features with the renormalization of gauge fields in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_3$ \\cite{An:2016fzu,Cvetic:2016eiv,Erdmenger:2016jjg}.    \n\n\n\\paragraph{Holographic renormalization} In order to determine the canonical transformation that diagonalizes the symplectic map between the canonical variables and the modes parameterizing the solutions of the linearized equations, i.e. the asymptotic expansions \\eqref{uv-exp} and \\eqref{uv-exp-momenta}, it is necessary to decompose the induced metric $\\lbar\\g_{ij}$ in the dual frame in time and spatial components in order to account for the non-relativistic scaling. Following \\cite{Chemissany:2014xsa} we parameterize $\\lbar\\g_{ij}$ as  \n\\be\n\\lbar\\g_{ij}dx^idx^j=-(n^2-n_a n^a)dt^2+2n_adtdx^a+\\s_{ab}dx^a dx^b,\\qquad a,b=1,\\ldots,d_s,\n\\ee\nin terms of the lapse function $n$, the shift function $n^a$ and the spatial metric $\\s_{ab}$.

Firstly, in writing \\eqref{bt} we have only included terms that contribute to the renormalization of the linearized canonical variables in the low frequency limit. In particular, we have not specified the boundary terms required to renormalize the background values of the canonical variables, or terms that involve spatial derivatives or more than one time derivative. Such terms can be determined systematically, but we do not need them here. In fact, this is one of the advantages of formulating holographic renormalization in the language of canonical transformations: it can be carried out directly within the context one works in, without having to first carry out the general procedure and then specialize to the case of interest. \n\nSecondly, the boundary term \\eqref{bt} is gauge invariant and so the renormalized gauge field $\\bb A_a^1$ transforms as the unrenormalized gauge potential $A_a^1$. Since the bulk action \\eqref{action-0} is also gauge invariant, it follows that the dual theory possesses a $U(1)^2$ global symmetry associated with the bulk gauge fields $A_a^I$.      \n\nThirdly, notice that the boundary term \\eqref{bt} is the generating function of a canonical transformation that is qualitatively different from the standard canonical transformation required for holographically renormalizing asymptotically AdS backgrounds. In particular, the term in the first line of \\eqref{bt} is a Legendre transform that changes the boundary condition imposed on the gauge field $A^1_a$ from Dirichlet to Neumann, while the second line in \\eqref{bt} is a local function of the canonical momentum $\\p^a_1$, which is holographically identified with the source when Neumann boundary conditions are imposed on $A^1_a$. This type of canonical transformation is also required for renormalizing gauge fields in asymptotically AdS$_2$ or AdS$_3$ backgrounds \\cite{An:2016fzu,Cvetic:2016eiv,Erdmenger:2016jjg}. As in those cases, the gauge field $A_a^1$ diverges asymptotically in the UV, as is evident from the asymptotic expansion in \\eqref{uv-exp}. Recall that the standard counterterms implement a canonical transformation that renormalizes the canonical momenta, while leaving the induced fields unchanged \\cite{Papadimitriou:2010as}. However, whenever the electric chemical potential is not the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of a gauge field, the canonical transformation required to render the variational problem well posed renormalizes the gauge potential instead of its conjugate momentum, as for example in \\eqref{transformed-variables}. Although the variational principle \\eqref{var-1} suggests that Neumann boundary conditions be imposed on the gauge field $A_a^1$, this is not necessarily the case. As we will see shortly, once the symplectic variables have been renormalized by means of the canonical transformation generated by \\eqref{bt}, an extra {\\em finite} boundary term can be added in order to change the boundary conditions on the gauge field back to Dirichlet, if so desired.\n \nFinally, to compare the boundary terms \\eqref{bt} with the more standard counterterms for asymptotically Lifshitz theories, e.g. in \\cite{Ross:2009ar,Ross:2011gu,Chemissany:2014xsa}, it is necessary to determine the general asymptotic solutions without linearizing around a background, which we leave for future work. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that there are some crucial differences between the system we consider here and typical asymptotically Lifshitz theories. Besides the hyperscaling violation that was considered also in \\cite{Chemissany:2014xsa}, the presence of a non-zero axion charge and of the second gauge field affects the asymptotic UV expansions non-trivially, as can be seen from \\eqref{uv-exp}. Moreover, in the present analysis we turn on a linear source for the energy flux, which is an irrelevant operator relative to the Lifshitz theory, but only consider massless gauge fields in the bulk.  \n\nIn order to determine the functions $h_1(\\f)$, $h_2(\\f)$, $h_3(\\f)$, $h_4(\\f)$ and $h_5(\\f)$ and demonstrate that the canonical transformation generated by the boundary term \\eqref{bt} renormalizes the symplectic variables, we need to evaluate the renormalized canonical variables \\eqref{transformed-variables} asymptotically.

From the variational principle \\eqref{var-1} follows that these renormalized variables have the correct radial scaling to be the conjugates of respectively $n_a$, $\\lbar\\p_1^a$ and $\\c^a$. Moreover, since they are related to the original symplectic variables by a canonical transformation they are automatically compatible with the symplectic structure of the theory and, therefore, can be directly identified with observables in the dual field theory.\n\nThe astute reader will have noticed that the scalar functions \\eqref{h-expressions} that define the boundary counterterms surprisingly depend on the mass $m$ and the electric charge $q_2$ of the background, in addition to the axion charge $p$ and the electric charge $q_1$ that is fixed by the Lifshitz boundary conditions. As we have pointed out above, while $p$ and $q_1$ parameterize non-normalizable modes, i.e. boundary conditions, $m$ and $q_2$ correspond to normalizable modes and define a state in the dual field theory. The local counterterms that renormalize a UV complete theory should not depend on the state! However, as we will see shortly, the mode $\\Th_1^a$ in the linearized fluctuations corresponds to the source of the energy flux, which is an irrelevant operator in the dual Lifshitz theory \\cite{Ross:2011gu}. It is well known that the counterterms required to renormalize a theory perturbed by a source of an irrelevant operator do in fact depend on the background one-point functions, i.e. on the state \\cite{vanRees:2011fr}. For example, using \\eqref{momentum-map} and \\eqref{Bans} one can relate the function $h_5(\\f)$ to the background canonical momentum\n\\be\n\\lbar\\p_{B\\; b}^a=-n_B^2\\sqrt{-\\lbar\\g}\\;h_5(\\f)\\d^a_b+\\cdots,\n\\ee\nwhich determines the VEV of the spatial stress tensor in the dual Lifshitz theory. A similar situation was encountered in the computation of two-point functions in a holographic Kondo model \\cite{Erdmenger:2016jjg}.   \n\nFinally, notice that the functions $h_2(\\f)$ and $h_4(\\f)$ contain a logarithmic term, i.e. linear in $\\f$, when $z=4/3$. Such terms would normally signify a conformal anomaly, but in the presence of a background running dilaton the notion of a conformal anomaly is ambiguous without reference to a UV fixed point \\cite{Chemissany:2014xsa,Taylor:2015glc}. Examples where a conformal anomaly in the presence of a running dilaton can be defined unambiguously include the D4-brane theory with its M5-brane UV completion \\cite{Kanitscheider:2009as}, as well as the AdS$_2$ dilaton-gravity theory studied in \\cite{Cvetic:2016eiv}, whose UV completions is provided by a two dimensional conformal field theory. However, in the present bottom-up context we are agnostic about the far UV completion of the theory and so we cannot unambiguously define a notion of a conformal anomaly. Nevertheless, it is interesting to observe that the logarithmic terms appear for the unique value of $z$ that, as we will see in section \\ref{sec:conductivities}, potentially leads to a linear resistivity at high temperature. \n\nHaving identified the canonical transformation that renormalizes the symplectic variables, we can define different holographic duals by imposing different boundary conditions on the bulk fields through additional {\\em finite} boundary terms. In the following we consider the two distinct theories obtained by imposing Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the spatial components $A_a^1$ of gauge field $A_i^1$, whose time component supports the Lifshitz background.\\footnote{We stress that imposing Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on the gauge fields in the bulk {\\em is not} equivalent to changing thermodynamic ensemble, as is often stated. Changing boundary conditions in general changes the dual theory \\cite{Witten:2003ya}.

Of course, these observables are only those turned on by the fluctuations we consider here.

More accurately, since $\\lbar\\p_1^i$ is constrained by the conservation equation $\\pa_i\\lbar\\p_1^i=0$ it cannot be directly identified with the arbitrary source of a local operator. The general (local) solution of the conservation equation, however, takes the form $\\lbar\\p_1^i=\\frac{2}{\\k^2}\\lbar\\e^{ijk}\\pa_j\\wt{\\bb a}_{ok}$, for some arbitrary  $\\wt{\\bb a}_{ok}$ that can be identified with the unconstrained source of the dual operator. This is a special case (the $S$-transformation) of the $SL(2,\\bb Z)$ transformation on the dual field theory first discussed in \\cite{Witten:2003ya}, or equivalently, particle-vortex duality \\cite{Herzog:2007ij}. In the bulk it corresponds to electric-magnetic duality. In fact, Neumann boundary conditions on $A_a^1$ are equivalent to Dirichlet boundary conditions for the magnetic dual $\\wt A_a^1$. Moreover, had we dualized the gauge field $A_a^1$ in the action \\eqref{action-0} from the start, the boundary term \\eqref{bt} would take the standard form of the local boundary counterterms and would involve the fieldstrength $\\wt F^1_{ij}$ of the magnetic dual gauge field $\\wt A_a^1$, in direct analogy to the electric and magnetic frame boundary counterterms computed in \\cite{An:2016fzu}.\n\nFor the fluctuations we turn on the only non-trivial components of the canonical momentum $\\lbar\\p_1^i$ are dualized according to  \n\\be\n\\lbar\\p_1^a=\\frac{2i\\o}{\\k^2}\\ve^{ab}\\wt{\\bb a}_{ob}^1,\n\\ee\nwhere $\\ve^{ab}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol in two dimensions.

As we shall see, the DC conductivities in the Dirichlet and Neumann theories are closely related, but are distinct.

Moreover, the conductivities \\eqref{DC-conductivities-N} are related to those of the Dirichlet theory in \\eqref{DC-conductivities-D} by an effective rescaling of the function $Z$ according to $Z(\\f_B(u_h))\\to Z(\\f_B(u_h))/\\cn$, where the factor $\\cn$ is defined in \\eqref{factors}. Nevertheless, the conductivities \\eqref{DC-conductivities-N} are not identical with those obtained from the near horizon analysis, which as we have seen above correspond to imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\\bb A_a^1$. The boundary conditions at the UV, therefore, crucially affect the computation of the conductivities. The thermoelectric conductivities \\eqref{DC-conductivities-N} can alternatively be obtained by dualizing the gauge field $A_i^1$ in the action \\eqref{action-0} from the very beginning and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on all fields. Presumably, the near horizon analysis of \\cite{Donos:2014cya} in the theory with the dual gauge field $\\wt A_i^1$ would produce the same result. \n    \nAn interesting feature of both electric conductivities \\eqref{DC-conductivities-D} and \\eqref{DC-conductivities-N} is that they satisfy the lower bound found in \\cite{Grozdanov:2015qia}, which in our theory takes the form\\footnote{It is unclear whether such a bound exits for the off-diagonal conductivities $\\bs^{ab}_{12}$ in the presence of two $U(1)$ gauge fields as in \\eqref{DC-conductivities-D}, since \\cite{Grozdanov:2015qia} considers only one gauge field.} \n\\be\\label{bound} \n\\bs^{ab}_{11}\\geq \\frac{2}{\\k^2}\\S_{11}(\\f_B(u_h))\\d^{ab},\\qquad \\bs^{ab}_{22},\\,\\,\\bs^{ab}_N\\geq \\frac{2}{\\k^2}\\S_{22}(\\f_B(u_h))\\d^{ab}.\n\\ee\nThis is expected for the conductivities $\\bs^{ab}_{11}$ and $\\bs^{ab}_{22}$ obtained by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions on $A_a^1$, since they agree with the near horizon result of \\cite{Donos:2014cya}, on which the bound of \\cite{Grozdanov:2015qia} relies. More interesting, and reassuring, is the fact that the Neumann conductivity $\\bs^{ab}_N$ also satisfies the same bound. A possible explanation for this is that the conductivities \\eqref{DC-conductivities-N} can be obtained from a near horizon analysis after dualizing the gauge field $A^1_\\m$ in the original action \\eqref{action-0}.  \n\t\nA lower bound on the thermal conductivity was also obtained in \\cite{Grozdanov:2015djs}. However, in contrast to the bound of \\cite{Grozdanov:2015qia} on the electric conductivity, the bound on the thermal conductivity assumes a relativistic conformal UV fixed point, and so it is not directly applicable to the class of theories we study here. Nevertheless, we can see traces of that bound in non-relativistic theories as well. The temperature of the black brane solution \\eqref{HVbackground} is given below in eq.~\\eqref{Texp}. For $\\th\\leq 0$, positivity of this temperature requires that\\footnote{For $\\th>0$ the inequality \\eqref{entropy-bound} ceases to hold and so it is unclear whether a lower bound on the thermal conductivity exists in that case.} \n\\be\\label{entropy-bound}\n\\frac{\\p s}{\\k^2p^2Z(\\f_B(u_h))}>\\frac{16\\p^2 v_h^{-\\th}}{2\\k^2(2-\\th)(2+z-\\th)},\n\\ee\nwhich translates to the thermal conductivity bounds\n\\be\\label{bound-thermal}\n\\frac{\\lbar\\bk^{ab}}{T}>\\frac{16\\p^2 v_h^{-\\th}}{2\\k^2(2-\\th)(2+z-\\th)}\\d^{ab},\\qquad  \\frac{\\lbar\\bk^{ab}_N}{T}>\\frac{16\\p^2 v_h^{-\\th}}{2\\k^2(2-\\th)(2+z-\\th)}\\cn\\d^{ab},\n\\ee \nrespectively for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on $A_a^1$. These expressions suggest that the thermal conductivity for Dirichlet boundary conditions in non-relativistic theories is still bounded from below, at least for $\\th\\leq 0$, but the one obtained from Neumann boundary conditions is less constrained, since the factor $\\cn$ can be made arbitrarily small, e.g. by taking $p^2$ to be small.\n\nAlthough the relativistic limit $z\\to 1$ does not generically commute with the asymptotic analysis in the UV, naively setting $z=1$ and $\\th=0$ one finds that the bounds \\eqref{bound-thermal} on the Dirichlet and Neumann conductivities coincide, since for $z=1$, $q_1=0$ and so $\\cn=1$, and take the simple form  \n\\be\\label{bound-thermal-relativisitc}\n\\frac{\\lbar\\bk^{ab}}{T},\\,\\,\\,\\frac{\\lbar\\bk^{ab}_N}{T} >\\frac{8\\p^2}{3}\\frac{\\d^{ab}}{2\\k^2}.\n\\ee \nThis lower bound is twice the one found in \\cite{Grozdanov:2015djs}, but this is not surprising given that the relativistic conductivities cannot in general be obtained simply by taking the $z\\to 1$ limit of the non-relativistic ones. Nevertheless, the result \\eqref{bound-thermal-relativisitc} of the naive relativistic limit of the non-relativistic bounds \\eqref{bound-thermal} suggests that a lower bound on the thermal conductivity analogous to the one in \\cite{Grozdanov:2015djs} exists for non-relativistic theories as well. It would be very interesting to see how universal these bounds are in non-relativistic theories.   \n \nFinally, the two-point functions in \\eqref{N-2-pt-functions} involving the particle-vortex dual current $\\wt \\cj_1^a$ give rise to the following thermoelectric conductivities:\n\\bal\\label{magnetic-conductivities}\n&\\;\\lim_{\\o\\to 0}\\frac{1}{i\\o}\\<\\wt\\cj_1^a(-\\o)\\cq_N^b(\\o)\\>=\\frac{2}{\\k^2}\\(\\m^1-\\frac{2\\p q_1\\ck T}{p^2Z(\\f_B(u_h))}\\)\\ve^{ab},\\NO\\\\\n&\\;\\lim_{\\o\\to 0}\\frac{1}{i\\o}\\<\\wt\\cj_1^a(-\\o)\\cj_2^b(\\o)\\>=\\frac{2}{\\k^2}\\(\\frac{8\\p q_1q_2\\ck}{p^2sZ(\\f_B(u_h))}\\)\\ve^{ab},\\NO\\\\\n&\\;\\lim_{\\o\\to 0}\\frac{1}{i\\o}\\<\\wt\\cj_1^a(-\\o)\\wt\\cj_1^b(\\o)\\>=\\frac{2}{\\k^2}\\ck\\d^{ab}.\n\\eal\nIn particular, the $\\wt\\cj_1\\wt\\cj_1$ conductivity is the inverse of the $\\cj_1\\cj_1$ one obtained from the Dirichlet theory in \\eqref{DC-conductivities-D}, in agreement with particle-vortex duality \n\\cite{Herzog:2007ij}. Note that the charge $q_1$ is a background magnetic charge in the Neumann theory, and $\\m^1$ is a magnetic chemical potential. Indeed, the thermoelectric conductivities \\eqref{magnetic-conductivities} have precisely the expected structure for a background that is purely electric for one gauge field and purely magnetic for the other. This can be checked qualitatively by comparing with the conductivities obtained in \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr}, where a background magnetic field is turned on for $A_i^2$. Replacing $B^{\\rm there}\\to q_1$, $q_1^{\\rm there}\\to q_2$, $q_2^{\\rm there}\\to 0$, where ``there'' refers to quantities defined in \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr}, eq.~(49) in \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr} is analogous to the $\\wt\\cj_1\\wt\\cj_1$ conductivity in \\eqref{magnetic-conductivities}, eq.~(46) in \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr} is analogous to the $\\wt\\cj_1\\cj_2$ conductivity in \\eqref{magnetic-conductivities}, and eq.~(57) in \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr} is analogous to the $\\wt\\cj_1\\cq$ conductivity in \\eqref{magnetic-conductivities}. This suggests that the thermoelectric DC conductivities on the dyonic background of \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr} can alternatively be obtained by considering mixed boundary conditions for the gauge field $A_a^2$, but in the purely electric background \\eqref{HVbackground}.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Temperature dependence and scaling regimes}\n\nNow that we have obtained the general form of the thermoelectric conductivities for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we would like to apply these results to the analytical black brane solutions (\\ref{HVbackground}) we considered in subsection \\ref{example}, and examine the associated temperature dependence.\n%\nWe are particularly interested in the differences between the possible scaling regimes for the two sets of \nboundary conditions.\n%\nWe remind the reader that the electrical part of the conductivity matrix for the model of subsection \\ref{example} was already  studied in \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj}, and therefore we will see some overlap with that discussion.\nHowever, while the analysis of \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj} \nprovided some preliminary insight into the conductive behavior of the system, \nit only discussed the electric conductivities corresponding to Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\\bb A_a^1$ without fully identifying the physical observables in the dual Lifshitz theory, and was therefore incomplete. Moreover, the analysis of \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj} considered only the case $\\th<0$ ($\\th>0$ in the conventions of \\cite{Cremonini:2016avj}). Here we revisit those results in light of the analysis of section \\ref{sec:linear} and expand on it by examining the full thermoelectric matrix for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on $\\bb A_a^1$, and for any $\\th<z$, both positive and negative.\n\nThe temperature $T = -\\frac{{\\rm sgn}(\\th)}{4\\pi} v_h^{z+1} \\cf^\\prime(v_h) $ of the black brane solutions (\\ref{HVbackground}) is given by\n\\be\n\\label{Texp}\\boxed{\n\tT = -\\frac{{\\rm sgn}(\\th)}{4\\p}\\Big((z+2-\\theta) v_h^z - \\frac{8q_2^2}{2-\\theta}v_h^{2\\theta-z-2} - \\frac{p^2}{2-\\theta} v_h^{\\theta-z}\\Big) \\, .}\n\\ee\nNote that for the range $1<z<2$, $\\theta<z$ we are considering, the first term inside the parenthesis is always positive and the remaining two negative, independently of the sign of $\\theta$. \nTo identify analytically relatively simple scaling regimes we would like to inspect two different limiting cases, high and low temperatures.

This would also complement the recent analysis of \\cite{Cremonini:2017qwq,Blauvelt:2017koq}, in which the special values $z=4/3$, $\\theta =0$ singled out by \\cite{Hartnoll:2015sea} were associated with a minimal DBI holographic model which could be used to reproduce, in the probe limit, the scalings of the resistivity $\\rho \\sim T$ and \nHall angle $\\cot \\Theta_H \\sim T^2$ of the cuprates \\cite{Blauvelt:2017koq}.   \n\nFinally, at arbitrary and low temperatures the expressions for the thermoelectric conductivities in the Neumann and Dirichlet cases generically differ from each other -- for both positive and negative values of $\\theta$ --  and a more extensive analysis of their temperature \nbehavior would have to be done numerically. \n\n\n\\section{Concluding remarks}\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\\setcounter{equation}{0}\n\nIn order to holographically identify the conserved currents responsible for the thermoelectric conductivities in a hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theory, it is necessary to place it at the UV, i.e. consider bulk solutions that are asymptotically locally hyperscaling violating Lifshitz, and to construct the physical observables through holographic renormalization. In this paper we have carried out this procedure for linearized fluctuations of the theory \\eqref{action-0} around the family of hyperscaling violating Lifshitz backgrounds \\eqref{HVbackground}. This analysis was considerably more involved compared to that for relativistic theories because the heat current involves the energy flux, which is an irrelevant operator in the dual Lifshitz theory when $z>1$. In particular, we showed that the boundary counterterms required to renormalize the theory in the presence of a source for the energy flux involve the radial canonical momentum conjugate to the gauge field supporting the Lifshitz asymptotics, in close resemblance to the renormalization of gauge fields in asymptotically AdS$_2$ and AdS$_3$ backgrounds \\cite{Cvetic:2016eiv,Erdmenger:2016jjg}. However, if the gauge field supporting the Lifshitz asymptotics in the action \\eqref{action-0} is dualized to its magnetic dual, the boundary counterterms would assume a more standard form that does not involve the canonical momenta  \\cite{An:2016fzu}.\n\nAn additional complication in the identification of the dual operators responsible for the thermoelectric conductivities is related to the choice of possible boundary conditions on the bulk fields. It is well known that the field theory dual of a given gravitational theory in the bulk is fully specified only once boundary conditions at infinity are imposed. In particular, the spectrum of local operators and their correlation functions are sensitive to the boundary conditions. Holographic conductivities are no exception. In this paper we have explicitly demonstrated the dependence of physical observables on the boundary conditions by computing analytically the thermoelectric DC conductivity matrix in a hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theory with two different boundary conditions on one of the two Maxwell fields present. Only Dirichlet boundary conditions lead to conductivities that agree with the result of the near horizon analysis \\cite{Donos:2014cya}, while Neumann boundary conditions produce a different set of DC conductivities. However, we expect that a near horizon analysis in the theory obtained by dualizing the Maxwell field supporting the Lifshitz background should reproduce the thermoelectric conductivities obtained by imposing Neumann boundary conditions in the original theory. It would be interesting to confirm this explicitly.  \n\nAlthough the thermoelectric conductivities we computed have a rich behavior as functions of the temperature, depending on the various parameters characterizing the background solution, we carried out a preliminary analysis by looking for parameter regions where the DC conductivities exhibit approximate scaling behavior with the temperature. We identified several clean scaling regimes in the limit of large temperature, which in our setup probes the Lifshitz theory in the UV. The thermoelectric conductivities obtained from Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the Maxwell field supporting the Lifshitz background scale generically differently with temperature. Rather intriguingly, the only case we could identify that can potentially lead to a linear resistivity arises in the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions and the specific value of the dynamical exponent $z=4/3$, which was also singled out in the field theory analysis of \\cite{Hartnoll:2015sea}.        \n\nThe work presented in this paper can be extended in several promising directions. An interesting generalization is to compute the optical (AC) thermoelectric conductivities for the same model and background we consider here. This should be relatively straightforward since the linearized equations we have obtained in appendix \\ref{sec:fluctuations} hold for arbitrary frequency, but solving them for general frequency would require extensive numerical analysis. \n\nAnother obvious extension of the current analysis is to include a background magnetic field, as was done for the model we study here in \\cite{Bhatnagar:2017twr}. A much simpler way to obtain the thermoelectric DC conductivities in a dyonic background, however, is to solve the linearized fluctuation equations for a purely electric background as we have done in this paper, and simply impose mixed boundary conditions on the gauge field $A_a^2$. Both procedures are equivalent and place the dual field theory on a dyonic background. In particular, the presence of a background magnetic field will facilitate the evaluation of the Hall angle and the magnetoresistance in the dual Lifshitz theory. These in turn will permit a more detailed comparison of the holographic DC conductivities with experimental observations for the cuprates. \n\nYet another potential direction to explore is turning on a mass for the bulk gauge field supporting the Lifshitz asymptotics so that the dual Lifshitz theory is characterized by an additional vector exponent \\cite{Gouteraux:2012yr}. This again would allow for a more direct comparison with the field theory results of \\cite{Hartnoll:2015sea}. Finally, it would be very interesting to revisit part of the asymptotic analysis of \\cite{Chemissany:2014xsa} for generic asymptotically locally hyperscaling violating Lifshitz theories in order to include a non-zero source for the energy flux and consider the effect of different boundary conditions on the bulk gauge field. We hope to address some of these questions in the near future. \n\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgments}\n\nS.C. would like to thank Blaise Gouteraux, Richard Davison and Li Li for valuable discussions.\nThis research is supported in part by the DOE Grant Award DE-SC0013528, (M.C.), the Fay R. and Eugene L.

In particular, the system of equations we derive can be used to compute the AC conductivities too, but in this paper we only solve them in the zero frequency limit. Moreover, we keep the background completely arbitrary and so the same linearized equations can be used to compute two-point functions in any background of the form \\eqref{Bans}. The analysis of the linearized fluctuations in this appendix is almost identical to that in \\cite{Lindgren:2015lia}, except that here we turn a background axion charge, but we set the background magnetic field to zero.  \n\nWe choose to work in a gauge where the Einstein frame metric takes the form\n\\be\nds^2=dr^2+\\g_{ij}(r,t)dx^idx^j,\n\\ee\nwhere $i,j$ run over the time $t$ and spatial dimensions $x^a$, and the radial component of the gauge fields is set to zero, i.e. $A^I_r=0$.

In this appendix we summarize the essential ingredients of the radial Hamiltonian formalism for the dual frame action \\eqref{action}. The exposition is identical to that in section 2 of \\cite{Chemissany:2014xsa}, except that (besides fixing a typo) here we include $d_s$ axions and an unspecified number of gauge fields.   \n\nThe first step in the Hamiltonian formalism is to decompose the metric and the gauge fields as\n\\be\\label{ADM-metric}\nd\\bar s^2=(\\lbar N^2+\\lbar N_i\\lbar N^i)d r^2+2\\lbar N_id r dx^i+\\lbar\\g_{ij}(r,x)dx^idx^j,\\qquad A^I_\\m dx^\\m=A^I_r dr+A^I_i dx^i,\n\\ee\nin terms of the lapse and shift functions, respectively $\\lbar N$ and $\\lbar N_i$, the induced metric $\\lbar \\g_{ij}$ on the radial slices $\\S_r$, as well as the longitudinal and transverse components of the gauge fields.

However, eliminating holes using structural deployment poses its difficulties. In either case, the resulting coverage holes can degrade overall network performance and lifetime. Many solutions utilizing Relay Nodes (RNs) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this regard, one of the recent solutions proposed using Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) to deploy RNs. This paper proposes RN deployment using two other evolutionary techniques - Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Differential Evolution (DE) and compares them with existing solution that uses ABC. These popular optimization tools are deployed to optimize the positions of relay nodes for lifetime maximization. Proposed algorithms guarantee satisfactory RNs utilization while maintaining desired connectivity level. It is shown that DE-based deployment improves the network lifetime better than other optimization heuristics considered.\n\\keywords{Artificial Bee Colony\\and Gravitational Search Algorithm\\and Differential Evolution\\and Constrained Optimization\\and Relay Deployment\\and Laplacian\\and Lifetime Enhancement\\and Graph-based Deployment.}\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\textbf{Acronyms:}\\\\\n    \\begin{tabular}{lcl}\n    ABC &:& Artificial Bee Colony.\\\\\n    CH &:& Cluster Head.\\\\\n    DE &:& Differential Evolution.\\\\\n    FPRNs &:& First-phase Relay Nodes.\\\\\n    GSA &:& Gravitational Search Algorithm.\\\\\n    MAC &:& Media Access Control.\\\\\n    MST &:& Minimum Spanning Tree.\\\\\n    NP-hard &:& Non-deterministic Polynomial-time Hard.\\\\\n    O3DwLC &:& Optimized 3-D deployment with Lifetime Constraints.\\\\\n    RNs &:& Relay Nodes.\\\\\n    SPRN &:& Second-phase Relay Nodes.\\\\\n    WSNs &:& Wireless Sensor Networks.\\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\n\\begin{table}[!hbp]\\caption{Table of Notations}\n\\begin{center}% used the environment to augment the vertical space\n% between the caption and the table\n\\begin{tabular}{r c p{6cm}}\n\\toprule\n$E_p$ &:& Total energy consumed by a node\\\\\n$I_R$ &:& Initial number of rounds using FPRN\\\\\n$T_R$ &:& Network lifetime\\\\\n$\\lambda_2$ &:& Fielder value\\\\\n$L$ &:& Laplacian matrix\\\\\n$A$ &:& Incidence matrix\\\\\n$G$ &:& Graph\\\\\n$B$ &:& Network backbone\\\\\n$W$ &:& Wiener index\\\\\n$\\mu$ &:& Average inter-node distance\\\\\n$\\beta$ &:& Penalty factor\\\\\n$MP$ &:& Mutation probability.\\\\\n$CP$ &:& Crossover probability.\\\\\n$x$ &:& Position of particle or solution.\\\\\n$v$ &:& Velocity of particle or solution.\\\\\n$a$ &:& Particle acceleration.\\\\\n$N$ &:& Number of particles or solutions in one generation.\\\\\n$G_c$ &:& Gravitational constant.\\\\\n$M$ &:& Mass of agent.\\\\\n$F$ &:& Gravitational force.\\\\\n$R$ &:& Euclidean distance.\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\label{TableNotations}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\indent\nApplication domains such as environmental monitoring and military field surveillance have witnessed an increasing interest in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In most of these applications, wireless sensors are deployed and expected to capture and then transmit parameters of interest such as temperature, pressure, and chemical activity to remote locations \\cite{younis2006node,werner2005monitoring}. WSN nodes are tiny, low-powered, and multi-functional and through collaboration they are able to perform complex tasks. From design viewpoint, optimizing the connectivity, lifetime, and cost of WSNs simultaneously is generally considered an intricate task \\cite{Turjman:2012,Chang:2012}. Dense deployment and unattended nature of WSNs make it quite difficult to recharge node batteries. Therefore, energy efficiency is a major design goal \\cite{younis2006node}. In view of striking balance, relay nodes (RN)s with less complicated circuitry but powerful transceivers are generally employed to foster the overall energy efficiency of network since their transmission and reception capabilities are better than sensor nodes \\cite{Cheng:2008}. It is worth noting that RNs are expensive than sensor nodes because they have more powerful transceivers and stronger battery banks. This is why a direct consequence of minimizing usage of RNs yields substantial reduction in overall WSN deployment cost.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nIn most applications, nodes are generally patterned in three-dimensional fashion and lifetime enhancement with cost and connectivity constraints becomes an arduous task. This is because network\'s traffic is in $3D$, that is, in x-y-z planar surfaces \\cite{Turjman:2012,Al-Turjman:2010,Son:2006}. Previous studies have shown that deployment in large $3D$ space is non-trivial. It has equally been shown that the combinatorial search space of this deployment problem is huge and each position translates to a different connectivity level. Therefore, the choice of optimization technique is paramount to ensure convergence \\cite{Bari:2007}. In general, the computational efficiency is often enhanced using heuristics \\cite{Turjman:2012}. These heuristics, especially the biologically inspired ones, are ubiquitously used to proffer solutions to a wide variety of engineering problems. Recently, promising evolutionary algorithms such as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) \\cite{Karaboga:2007}, Genetic Algorithm (GA) \\cite{gupta2016genetic}, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) \\cite{rashedi_gsa:_2009}, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) \\cite{magan2016optimal}, and Differential Evolution (DE) \\cite{storn_differential_1997} have efficiently solved complex contemporary problems with high computational cost.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nRN deployment in WSN applications is broadly categorized into grid and non-grid-based deployment. In grid-based deployment, precise localization and data measurements are achievable because nodes are deployed on predefined grid vertices. In non-grid-based approaches, nodes are deployed in a multi-dimensional ad hoc manner. In practical 3-D settings, grid-based approaches are generally preferred to non-grid because the infinite search space in non-grid-based approach is reduced into a reasonably finite one. It has been shown that one way to tackle connectivity issues in WSNs is by deploying redundant nodes to repair connectivity when network partitioning occurs \\cite{Cerpa:2004}. Redundant nodes were turned "on" only when the network connectivity was below a predefined threshold. Node\'s mobility has also been used to improve connectivity of a disconnected network \\cite{Marta:2009}. Deployment area was modeled as a grid with cells of equal size and few number of RNs are carefully populated to connect the disjointed WSN segments. Network optimization is performed in such a way that RNs are deployed in least number of cells till connection is restored in all the segments \\cite{Lee:2006,Lee:2010}.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nIn \\cite{patel2005energy,capone2010deploying}, integer linear programming was utilized to determine the optimal positions of sensor node, relay nodes, and base station (BS) that guarantee desired coverage, connectivity, bandwidth, and robustness. Since these deployments rely on the linearity property that is of importance in linear programming, it will be difficult to capture the nonlinear dynamics that can be introduced due to effect such as parameter variations especially in rugged terrains. Also, a two-tier two-phase architecture where sensor nodes are logically separated from backbone devices was proposed to repress the complexity of RN deployment \\cite{Turjman:2012,Abbasi:2009}. In this two-tier strategy, sensor nodes are solely responsible for sensing and transmitting data to their corresponding cluster head (CH) or the closest RN. Hence, sensor nodes occupy the first layer of the architecture. In this design, sensor nodes are made to sleep when idle to minimize their energy consumption. In the first deployment phase, backbone was connected by deploying first-phase relay nodes (FPRNs) on candidate vertices in a 3-D fashion using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The purpose of deploying these FPRNs is to initiate connections among CHs and BS whose positions are fixed. In the second deployment phase of Shortest-Path-3D grid deployment (SP3D), desired connectivity was achieved by randomly deploying more RNs near the backbone devices.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nOptimized 3-D deployment with Lifetime Constraints (O3DwLC) \\cite{Turjman:2012} is an improvement on SP3D and was developed to enhance network connectivity. The main difference between between SP3D and O3DwLC is evident in the way RNs are deployed in the second phase. In second phase of O3DwLC strategy, a semi-positive definite optimization algorithm was used to efficiently enhance the network connectivity subject to cost and lifetime constraints. It is worth mentioning that the proposed approach in this paper differs from those in SP3D and O3DwLC in the sense that it focuses on using minimum number of relay nodes to maximize the useful WSN lifetime with meta-heuristics approach. A two-tier constrained RN placement was proposed to improve the energy efficiency of a single-cover problem scenario, however, the solution utilizes more relay nodes than necessary \\cite{10.1109/TMC.2011.126}. In addition, if the candidate positions are known a priori, a minimum number of relay nodes are capable of harvesting energy that can be utilized to improve both the connectivity and survivability of the network \\cite{6583152}. Even though the idea of using partition detection/recovery algorithm and relay node mobility to detect and renew the connectivity of partitioned network sounds interesting, however, this type of solution involves mobile robots and other electronic circuitry, which could render it cost ineffective to implement especially in rugged terrains \\cite{10.1109/TC.2009.120}.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nDE, GSA, and ABC have been shown as promising evolutionary tools for finding global optima for a variety of optimization problems with large search space. Many research disciplines, such as cloud manufacturing \\cite{zhou2016hybrid}, bioinformatics \\cite{karaboga2016discrete,ogundijo2017bayesian,ogundijo2016reverse}, electrical dispatch \\cite{neto2017solving}, and big data \\cite{sabar2017heterogeneous,han2017novel} have successfully adopted these evolutionary techniques for solving different non-trivial search problems. In general, optimization techniques converge to optimal solution in search space with predefined size, where the size is defined by a number of optimized parameters satisfying some constraints. Evolutionary algorithms are heuristics\nand it is worth noting that there is no one-size-fits-all evolutionary technique for all optimization problems \\cite{hashim2015fuzzy}. Some heuristics converge faster to better solutions than others in some problems and slower in other problems. Therefore, the three benchmark algorithms in this work belong to different search families. DE relies on genetic mutation and crossover \\cite{storn_differential_1997}, ABC uses the roles of three main groups within a bee colony \\cite{Karaboga:2007} and GSA is based on gravitational laws and mass interactions between particles \\cite{rashedi_gsa:_2009}.\\\\\n\\indent\nThese optimization algorithms have been used in different contexts to optimize various capacities of WSNs. Coverage and connectivity have both been maximized using territorial predator scent marking algorithm; the algorithm also guarantees least overall energy consumption \\cite{Abidin:2014}. ABC and Particle Swarm Optimization have also been utilized to solve sensor nodes placement and lifetime maximization problem \\cite{Mini:2014}. In addition to all the aforementioned heuristic based applications, ant colony with greedy migration has also been utilized to deploy sensor nodes with a view to maximizing coverage and minimizing network deployment cost. A multi-objective approach has also been utilized to solve RN placement problem by optimizing three conflicting objectives - network reliability, cost, and average sensitivity area \\cite{lanza2015assuming}. Unlike \\cite{Udgata:2011,Mini:2014,Abidin:2014} that mainly focused on finding the optimal sensor node positions that enhance the network lifetime, heuristic-based RN deployment here proposed focuses on improving the network lifetime by deploying fewest number of RNs while satisfying connectivity constraint . Other closely related work to ours is that in \\cite{magan2016optimal} that focused on optimal relay node placement in multi-hop scenario. In their approach, a two-step procedure and optional third step were utilized to optimize the network connectivity and throughput using PSO algorithm. The key difference compared to our method is that our method aims at optimizing network lifetime with lower bound constraints on network connectivity and upper bound constraint on cost of deployment.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nLifetime maximization with cost and connectivity constraint problem introduced in \\cite{Hashim:2015}, formulated using a two-phase two-tier approach. The approximate solution of the problem addressed has been shown to be NP-hard \\cite{Bari:2007,Efrat:2008}. The complexity was extenuated using a two-phase two-tier strategy. The connectivity of network backbone was achieved by deploying least number of first-phase RNs for cost effectiveness \\cite{Hashim:2015}. Evolutionary-based heuristic was utilized in the second phase to search for near-optimal positions of RNs. Optimization of network parameters was implemented to satisfy minimum application specific connectivity level constraint and guarantee minimum objective function. The placement problem was formulated in such a way that network cost and connectivity were simultaneously constrained in the desired range. ABC was employed as the evolutionary heuristic to search the optimal positions. In this work, the main contributions are: (i) the objective function in \\cite{Hashim:2015} has been reformulated using additional penalty term for optimal performance, (ii) two other evolutionary techniques (DE and GSA) have been used in the second phase to efficiently deploy the RNs, (iii) the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is compared and contrasted with \\cite{Hashim:2015} on the basis of network lifetime enhancement and speed of convergence, and lastly (iv) comprehensive experiments have been carried out to show the efficacy (faster convergence and better optimal solution) of using DE as opposed to ABC presented in \\cite{Hashim:2015} to deploy backbone devices in WSNs. \\\\\n\\indent\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the formulation of the problem statement . Section 3 describes the proposed deployment scheme and its mapping into an optimization problem. Section 4 describes the software implementation and results. Section 5 concludes the main findings and observations.\n\\section{Network Model and Placement Problem Formulation}\nThis section delineates the proposed network model. Hierarchical network architecture is assumed to address node heterogeneity problem. Graph topology is considered for easy network abstraction and effective computation of inter-node distances.\\\\*[-2.3pc]\n\\subsection{Assumptions}\nThe network considered in this work mainly comprises of sensor nodes, CHs, RNs, and BS. Network heterogeneity is addressed using a two-tier hierarchical architecture shown in Fig.~\\eqref{twolayer}. In the adopted design, sensor nodes occupy lower layer and they primarily collect data of interest and relay information to upper layer devices (RN or CH). It is assumed in this architecture that sensor nodes are only used for data sensing and transmission over short distances and that nodes sleep when idle. The CHs, RNs, and BS constitute the upper layer building blocks. Upper layer devices have stronger transceiver circuitry to transmit and receive data over longer distances. These devices also relay information from sensor nodes periodically to the base station.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nIt is also assumed in this work that sensor nodes have enough energy to perform their sensing duties. This assumption gives the flexibility to focus on the upper layer devices. It has also been established that data sensing and processing requires lesser energy consumption than data transmission and reception \\cite{Santamaria:2010,Olariu:2006}. Thus, energy consumed during data transmission and reception is only considered.\n \\begin{figure}[H]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Fig_2_twolayer}\n  \\caption{Two-tiered hierarchical scheme.}\\label{twolayer}\n\\end{figure}\nIn addition, this two-tier approach decouples energy utilization of upper layer from lower layer as shown in Fig.~\\eqref{twolayer}. Other assumptions in this work are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Nodes in the network are considered to be static.\n % \\item Sensed data from nodes can either be transmitted to CHs or RNs and to another CHs or RNs and then to BS.\n  \\item Multi-hop communication is considered.\n  \\item The transmission and reception range of all CHs are the same.\n  \\item The transmission and reception range of all RNs are the same.\n  \\item The Media Access Control (MAC) protocol is ideal, that is, no packet collision and retransmission is experienced.\\\\*[-1pc]\n\\end{itemize}\n\\subsection{Energy Utilization Model}\nThe adopted two-tier architecture and the assumption that sensor nodes have enough resources to perform their tasks allows the isolation of lower layer energy utilization. This affords the flexibility to focus on the energy utilization of upper layer devices. Therefore, on the energy utilizations of RNs, CHs, and BS are considered. The energy consumption model proposed in \\cite{Xu:2010,Rodrigues:2007} is also utilized in this work. Energy consumption of receiving device is:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq1}\n  \\begin{split}\n  J_{rx} &= L\\beta,\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nand that consumed by transmitting device is given by:\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq2}\n  \\begin{split}\n  J_{tx} &= L(\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2 d^{\\gamma}),\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nwhere $\\beta$, $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$ are transceiver hardware parameters \\cite{Turjman:2012}, $L$ is the length of a packet, $d$ is the Euclidean distance between the transmitter and receiver, and $\\gamma$ is the path loss exponent.\nRemaining energy $E_{r}$, is given by:\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq3}\n  \\begin{split}\n  E_{r} &= E_i-TJ_{tx}-RJ_{rx}-\\underline{A}J_a\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nwhere $T$, $R$ and $\\underline{A}$ are the arrival rates of transmitted, received and aggregated packets per round, respectively; $E_{i}$ is the initial energy of each node; $J_{tx}$, $J_{rx}$, and $J_a$ are energy per unit time consumed by each node for a single packet transmission, reception and aggregation, respectively.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\indent\nThe energy mode in this work also incorporates the effect of packets transmitted by a RN to BS on behalf of other RNs. It is remarked that this effect depends on how close a RN is to BS. The closer a RN is to BS, the more the likelihood of relaying more data and the faster it depletes its energy. This subset of RNs is prone to causing prematurely network partitioning than other nodes thereby leading to early performance degradation. Incorporating this effect in the energy consumption model yields:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq4}\n  \\begin{split}\n  E_{p} &= kTJ_{tx}+ kRJ_{rx} + \\underline{A}J_{a}\n  \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n where $k=$ packets received and relayed by a RN from other RNs.\\\\*[-.1pc]\nBy letting the initial rounds $I_R$ denote the total number of rounds the first-phase RNs can stay operational, overall network lifetime (in rounds) is derived as follows:\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq12}\n  \\begin{split}\n   I_R= \\tfrac{B_1}{\\sum_{p=1}^{FPRN}E_p}\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n where $B_1$ $=$ network energy after deploying FPRN\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq13}\n  \\begin{split}\n   Lifetime= T_R= \\tfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{2}B_i}{\\sum_{p=1}^{FPRN+SPRN}E_p}\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n where\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq14}\n  \\begin{split}\n   E_{p} = kTL(\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2 \\mu_{w} ^{\\gamma})+ kRL \\beta + \\underline{A}J_{a},\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n with $\\mu_{w}$ denoting the average internode distance, and $B_2$ being the energy introduced by deploying SPRN. Then network lifetime (in rounds) is given as:\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq15}\n  \\begin{split}\n   Lifetime= T_R= I_R + \\sum_{i=1}^{n_c}\\alpha_i E_R\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nwhere $E_R =$ extra rounds achievable due to addition of one second-phase RN to a candidate position; $n_c$ is the number of candidate positions a second-phase RN can be placed on the grid and $\\alpha_i$ is 1 if second-phase RN is placed on vertex $i$ and 0 otherwise.\n\\subsection{Network Lifetime Definition}\\label{defn}\nWireless sensor network lifetime is defined in this work as the maximum number of rounds achievable before network partitioning occurs, that is, the duration in rounds when most RNs and CHs have depleted their energy and are no longer able to relay packets to the next hop or sink. This lifetime definition can also be interpreted as the duration from deployment to instance when the algebraic network connectivity and total energy fall below some partition thresholds. The assumption that network connectivity and/or lifetime directly depend(s) on the activity of CHs/RNs originates from the two-layer architecture adopted. The connectivity of network backbone is highly dependent on the connectivity of RNs. In practice, energy partition threshold can vary from application to application and from network to network. These variations are due to factors such as power rating of the transceivers, node\'s density and position of RNs within a network. It is also noted that the definition adopted in this paper does not take cognizance of such factors. In order to avoid threshold variations within the network, partition threshold is set based on the total energy in network backbone and not on the energy of individual RN.\n\\subsection{Problem Statement}\nBy predefining the positions of sensor nodes, CHs, BS, and first-phase RNs, the aim is to find the positions of pre-determined number of second-phase RNs (SPRNs) on the grid that enhance the overall network lifetime. That is, if given the grid locations of sensor nodes, CHs, first-phase RNs, and BS, the objective is to find near-optimal positions of predetermined number of SPRNs on 3-D grid that maximize the network lifetime while satisfying connectivity constraints. The network cost is constrained by ensuring the number of SPRNs do not be exceed a predefined number. The second phase of the proposed deployment strategy is where RNs are strategically deployed using optimization heuristics. The positions of SPRNs are optimized using two algorithms that are known for searching global optimum. The objective in this phase is to minimize the average internode distances, $\\mu_w\\left(G\\right)$ with constraints on the number of SPRNs that can be deployed and the algebraic network connectivity. This optimization problem is then formulated as:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq9}\n  \\begin{split}\n   \\min_{\\alpha} \\left(\\mu_{w}\\left(L\\left(\\alpha\\right)\\right) + \\beta \\max \\{0, \\left(\\lambda_{2,FPRN}-\\lambda_{2,FPRN+SPRN}\\right)\\}\\right), \\\\\n   s.t \\ \\ \\ \\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_c} \\alpha_i = N_{SPRN},\\ \\ \\ {\\rm where} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\alpha_i\\in [0,1],\n  \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq11}\n  \\begin{split}\n   L\\left(\\alpha\\right)=L_i+ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_c}\\alpha_i A_i A_i^T\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nwhere $A_i$ is the incidence matrix generated by adding SPRNs, $L_i$ is the initial Laplacian generated using MST; $n_c$ is the number of candidate grid locations for SPRNs and $\\alpha_i$ is 1 if SPRN is placed on vertex $i$ otherwise 0. The mathematical derivations of overall network lifetime is given in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq4}-\\eqref{MyEq15}. $\\beta$ controls the importance imposed on connectivity constraint and was experimentally set to $1$. As a test case, $\\lambda_{2,FPRN}$ was set to $0.5$.\\\\\n\\indent\nIt is worth mentioning that the penalty term added to the objective function in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq9} enforces the connectivity constraint. As opposed to a hard connectivity constraint imposed in \\cite{Hashim:2015}, a soft constraint is here enforced and it is remarked that soft constraint gives the optimizer flexibility necessary to find good local optimal in the objective function landscape.\n\\section{The Meta-heuristic Based Deployment Strategies}\nIn this section, RN deployment strategy using evolutionary optimization tools is described in detail. The two optimizers are objectively compared and contrasted with ABC in terms of their effectiveness in finding optimal SPRN grid positions and in terms of convergence speed. It is worth noting that the NP-Hard properties of this deployment problem can be circumvented using a two-tier two-phase architecture, which is similar to what was adopted in \\cite{Turjman:2012,Hashim:2015}. In the first phase of deployment, MST constructs the network backbone using first-phase RNs (FPRNs) and ensures that RNs, CH, and BS are connected to a desired connectivity level \\cite{Turjman:2012}. The pseudocode of MST is given in Algorithm~1 as implemented in \\cite{Turjman:2012}.\\\\*[.3pc]\n\\begin{algorithm}\n\\caption{MST: FPRN Deployment (Construct Backbone $B$)}\n\\label{alg:MST}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n   \\STATE  {\\bf Initialize} :\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ Initial number of CHs and BS to construct $B$};\n   \\STATE  {\\bf Input} :\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A set IS of the CHs and BS nodes coordinates};\n   \\STATE  {\\bf Output} :\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A set CC of the CHs, minimum RNs, and BS coordinates forming}\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ the network Backbone};\n   \\STATE  {\\bf begin}\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ CC $=$ set of closest two nodes in IS;}\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ CC $=$ CC $\\cup$ minimum RNs needed to connect them on the 3-D grid};\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ IS $=$ IS - CC};\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ CC = CC [ minimum RNs needed to connect them on the 3-D grid};\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ $N_d$ $=$ number of remaining IS nodes which are not in CC};\n   \\STATE  {$i = 0$};\n   \\STATE  {\\bf for} each remaining node $n_i$ in IS.\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ Calculate $M_i$: Coordinates of minimum number of RNs required}\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ to connect $n_i$ with the closest node in CC}.\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ $i = i + 1$};\n   \\STATE  {\\bf end.}\n   \\STATE  $M = {Mi}$\n   \\STATE  {\\bf while} $Nd > 0$ do :\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ SM $=$ Smallest $M_i$};\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ CC$=$ CC $\\cup$ SM $\\cup$ $n_i$};\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ IS $=$ IS-$n_i$};\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ M $=$ M - $M_i$};\n   \\STATE  {\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ $N_d $=$ N_d - 1$};\n   \\STATE  {\\bf end.}\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n%\\\\*[.2pc]\n%\\indent\nIf network backbone $B$ is perceived as a connected graph ($G$) then from graph theory, Laplacian ($L$) can be constructed from $G$ \\cite{Ghosh:2010,Bhardwaj:2001,Boyd:2006}. $L$ is symmetric, semi-positive definite, and element $\\left(i,j\\right)$ has a value of $-1$ if node $i$ can receive and send packets to node $j$. The principal diagonal elements L$\\left(i,i\\right)$ have positive integer numbers that denote the number of RNs connected to node $i$ \\cite{Turjman:2012}. The ordering of eigenvalues of $L$ is given in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq5} below:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq5}\n  \\begin{split}\n  0=\\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\leq \\lambda_3 \\leq ....\\lambda_{n-1} \\leq \\lambda_n,\\\\\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nwhere $\\lambda_2$ is known as the Fielder value. Note that $\\lambda_2 = 0$ when there is no connectivity in $G$. By implication, the algebraic connectivity of backbone $G$ is characterized by $\\lambda_2$. It is remarked that connectivity level of the network can be tuned to a desired level by strategically augmenting the number of FPRNs using the MST. On the other hand, $\\lambda_2 = 1$ denotes when the network is well connected, that is, all the nodes have direct connections to every other nodes. An example of a connected 10-node-12-link backbone (or graph) is given in Fig.~\\ref{laplacian}. It is worthy of note that removing one node may partition the entire network. For instance, node 3 in Fig.~\\ref{laplacian} is a typical illustration of a node whose removal could partition the network backbone. The Laplacian matrix ($L$) generated from Fig.~\\ref{laplacian} is given in \\eqref{MyEq5a} with specific $\\lambda_2$. The Fielder value ($\\lambda_2$) of the matrix ($L$) denotes the link count needed for network partitioning \\cite{Turjman:2012}.\n\n \\begin{figure}[h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Fig_1_Laplac.pdf}\n  \\caption{An example of a 10-node-12-link graph.}\\label{laplacian}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq5a}\nL_{10}= {\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 3 & -1 & 0 &0&0&-1&-1&0&0&0\\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 &0&0&0&0&0&0&0\\\\ 0 & -1 & 3 &-1&0&0&0&-1&0&0\\\\0 & 0 & -1 &2&-1&0&0&0&0&0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 &-1&3&0&0&-1&0&-1\\\\-1 & 0 & 0 &0&0&2&-1&0&0&0\\\\-1 & 0 & 0 &0&0&-1&2&0&0&0\\\\0 & 0 & -1 &0&-1&0&0&3&-1&0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 &0&0&0&0&-1&2&-1\\\\0 & 0 & 0 &0&-1&0&0&0&-1&2 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right)}\n%\\]\\\\\n\\end{equation}\nThe following definitions in \\cite{Merris:1990} are adopted in this work:\n\\begin{enumerate}\\label{Enume1}\n                  \\item Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V\\left(G\\right)$ and edge set $E\\left(G\\right)$. The distance $d_G\\left(u,v\\right)$ between two vertices $u,v \\in V \\left(G\\right)$ is the minimum number of edges on a path in $G$ between $u$ and $v$.\n                  \\item $d_G\\left(v\\right)$ is defined as the distance of a vertex $v$ in $G$ and it is given as the sum of all distances between vertex $v$ and all other vertices of $G$.\n                  \\item The Wiener index $W\\left(G\\right)$ is a property of graph $G$ and is related to $d_G\\left(v\\right)$ through :\n                \\end{enumerate}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq6}\n \\begin{split}\n   W\\left(G\\right) &= \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{v\\in V\\left(G\\right)}d_G\\left(v\\right)=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sum_{\\left(u,v\\right)\\in V\\left(G\\right)}d_G\\left(u,v\\right)\\\\\n  \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ compensates for the fact that distance between $u$ and $v$ are summed twice since $G$ is undirected. On averaging the distance between every pair of vertices of $G$, we obtain the average distance $\\mu\\left(G\\right)$:\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq7}\n \\begin{split}\n  \\mu\\left(G\\right) &= \\tfrac{W\\left(G\\right)}{\\tfrac{n}{2}}=\\tfrac{W\\left(G\\right)}{\\left(\n                                              \\begin{array}{c}\n                                                \\lvert V\\left(G\\right)\\rvert\\ \\\\\n                                                2 \\\\\n                                              \\end{array}\n                                            \\right)\n  }\\\\\n \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nEq. \\eqref{MyEq7} is modified to Eq. \\eqref{MyEq7b} in order to incorporate any unmodeled variation in the average distance. Unmodeled variation is added to the cost function as a constant penalty term. This gives the proposed solution a level of robustness - a feature that makes it fit into many real life scenarios.\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq7b}\n \\begin{split}\n  \\mu_{w} \\left(G\\right) &= \\tfrac{W\\left(G\\right)}{\\tfrac{n}{2}}=\\tfrac{W\\left(G\\right)}{\\left(\n                                              \\begin{array}{c}\n                                                \\lvert V\\left(G\\right)\\rvert\\ \\\\\n                                                2 \\\\\n                                              \\end{array}\n                                            \\right)\n  }+\\Delta\\mu\\left(G\\right)\\\\\n \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n$\\Delta\\mu\\left(G\\right)$ is added to account for unpredictable occurrences such as slight displacement of nodes by surrounding air.

The following subsections briefly describe the two optimization techniques implemented in the proposed algorithm.\n\\subsection{Differential Evolution}\nDifferential evolution is a technique that was initially developed and tested on "Chebychev Polynomial fitting problem", which later metamorphosed into an impressive optimization technique \\cite{storn_differential_1997}. In addition to retaining a better population and solution, DE uses the same structure as Genetic Algorithm such as crossover and mutation. In the mutation and crossover search process, important relations are used. Mutation requires assigning an arbitrary constant between 0 and 1 called the mutation probability (MP), and mutation relation is calculated only if MP is greater than a random number between 0 and 1 as follows:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq100}\n    v_i\\left(t+1\\right) = x_i\\left(t\\right) + \\mathcal{F}\\left(x_{best}\\left(t\\right) - x_i\\left(t\\right)\\right)  + \\mathcal{F}\\left(x_{r_1}\\left(t\\right)- x_{r_2}\\left(t\\right)\\right)\n \\end{equation}\nThe crossover is evaluated using a relation where crossover probability (CP) is arbitrarily set to a value between 0 and 1, and then compared to a random number between 0 and 1. The crossover step is executed only if CP is greater than the random number. The crossover equation is then calculated using the relation:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq101}\n  \\begin{split}\n    x_i\\left(t+1\\right) = v_i\\left(t+1\\right)\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\nwhere $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N$ and $i$ is iteration number for every solution in the generation;  $\\mathcal{F}>0$ is a constant factor; $x_i\\left(t\\right)$ denotes a solution at iteration $i$ in the generation; $v_i\\left(t+1\\right)$ is a mutant vector given in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq100}; $x_{r_1}\\left(t\\right)$ and $x_{r_2}$ are solution vectors selected randomly from current generation; $x_{best}\\left(t\\right)$ is the best solution. A more detailed description of DE can be looked up in \\cite{storn_differential_1997}. Summary of the algorithm is shown in the flowchart Fig. \\ref{Fig_4_DE}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Fig_4_DE.pdf}\n  \\caption{DE computational flowchart.}\\label{Fig_4_DE}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Gravitational Search Algorithm}\nGravitational search algorithm (GSA) is an important meta heuristic optimization algorithm that is based on Newton\'s laws of gravitation and it was initially proposed in 2009 \\cite{rashedi_gsa:_2009}. The algorithm follows the gravitational law which stipulates that: "for any two objects, every object is attracted to the other object by a force which is directly proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to their square distance". According to the principle of gravity, the force between any two nodes can be evaluated by\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq201}\n  \\begin{split}\n    F = G_c\\frac{M_1M_2}{R^2}\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n where $M_1$ and $M_2$ are masses of the particles, $G_c$ is the gravitational constant, $R$ is the Euclidean distance between the two particles and $F$ is the gravitational force. It should be noted that $G_c$ is defined in the GSA algorithm by\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq202}\n  \\begin{split}\n    G_c\\left(t\\right) = G_c\\left(t_{0}\\right){\\rm exp}\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha t}{T}\\right)\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n such that $G_c\\left(t\\right)$ is the gravitational constant at any time $t$, $G_c\\left(t_{0}\\right)$ is the initial value of gravitational constant at time $t_0$, $\\alpha$ is a positive constant and $T$ is final time, which can be assigned based on number of iterations. The particle acceleration is given by\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq203}\n  \\begin{split}\n    a_{i}^{d}\\left(t\\right) = \\frac{F_{i}^{d}\\left(t\\right)}{M_{i}\\left(t\\right)}\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n where $i = 1,\\ldots,N$ and $d = 1,\\ldots,D$ such that $N$ is number of particles and $D$ is number of optimized parameters within the particle. $F_{i}^{d}$ is force of particle $x_{i}^{d}$ and ${M_{i}}$ is the mass of particle $i$. Next, positions and velocities of each parameter can be defined according to the following relations\n \\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq204}\n   \\begin{split}\n     v_{i}^{d}\\left(t+1\\right) = rand_iv_{i}^{d}\\left(t\\right) + a_{i}^{d}\\left(t\\right)\n   \\end{split}\n  \\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq205}\n  \\begin{split}\n    x_{i}^{d}\\left(t+1\\right) =  x_{i}^{d}\\left(t\\right) + v_{i}^{d}\\left(t+1\\right)\n  \\end{split}\n \\end{equation}\n  where $x_{i}^{d}\\left(t+1\\right)$ and  $v_{i}^{d}\\left(t+1\\right)$ are the position and velocity of parameter $d$ in particle $i$ at time $t+1$ or at the next iteration, respectively. Also, $rand_i$ is a random number between 0 and 1. A detailed explanation of the GSA is given in \\cite{rashedi_gsa:_2009} and the flowchart in Fig. \\ref{Fig_5_GSA} gives the synopsis of the algorithm \\cite{rashedi_gsa:_2009,Hash:2015}.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Fig_5_GSA.pdf}\n  \\caption{GSA computational flowchart.}\\label{Fig_5_GSA}\n\\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Implementation of the Optimization algorithms }\nThe proposed deployment is formulated using optimization algorithms to update the initial Laplacian ($L_i$) obtained from MST algorithm. Using the observation that the algebraic network connectivity is the second least eigenvalue ($\\lambda_2$) of $L$, the connectivity can be constrained within a desired bound during optimization using a penalty function. It is worth noting that $L$ is symmetric and the magnitude of the off-diagonal row or column elements sum up to their corresponding diagonal elements. By considering the probabilistic communication model, network connectivity is the likelihood that two nodes separated by distance $d$ can establish communication is:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{MyEq15c}\n  \\begin{split}\n P_c = \\varpi e^{-\\mu d^\\gamma}\n  \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $d$ is the distance of separation between the transmitting and receiving nodes, $\\gamma$ is the path loss exponent which is empirically determined, $\\mu$ is a random variable that describes the attenuation encountered by signals upon deployment, and $\\varpi$ is a constant estimated from the heights of transmitter, receiver, and monitored site. It can be deduced from Eq. \\eqref{MyEq15c} that connectivity depends not only on separating distance between nodes but also on many other factors such as shadowing (due to obstacles) and multipath effects (due to terrain)  \\cite{Turjman:2012}.\\\\\n\\indent\nDuring the second phase deployment, our algorithm deploys SPRNs on candidate positions based on where the objective function is minimum and then updates the matrix $L$ accordingly as depicted in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq11}. The objective function of the optimization is given in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq8}. The aim of the optimizer is to  minimize the objective function subject to constraints on cost and $\\lambda_2$. Both DE and GSA are separately used as tools for optimizing the network parameters. The algorithms optimize the off-diagonal elements of $L$ by terminating some connections with value 0 and/or reconnecting other with value -1. The algorithm ensures that the connectivity constraint is satisfied before a position is accepted as a feasible solution. The updated Laplacian matrix is used to evaluate the average distance among the RNs/CHs using Eq. \\eqref{MyEq7}. The lifetime is then evaluated using the set of equations in the Eq. \\eqref{MyEq4}-\\eqref{MyEq15}.\\\\*[.4pc]\n\\indent\nIt must be remarked that one essential factor in the energy utilization model is the distance between the transmitting and receiving nodes as given in Eq.\\eqref{MyEq14}. Since $\\left(\\mu_w\\left(G\\right)\\right)$ is proportional to $W\\left(G\\right)$, the optimizers evaluate the fitness using $W\\left(G\\right)$. The size of $L$ is determined by the total number of backbone devices, that is, total number of RNs, CHs, and BS. The number of SPRNs is incremented and are placed on candidates vertices and the Laplacian matrix is updated. The major challenge of the optimizers is choosing best set of locations that result in least average inter-node distance. SPRNs are randomly placed on a subset of candidate vertices and the algorithm checks if the fielder value of the new $L$ is within the specified bounds before accepting or discarding a solution. This process continues until the solution converges. The best deployment with the smallest internode distances is returned by the algorithm. The nodes that are directly connected to the SPRNs will be visible using the most recently updated Laplacian matrix, $L$. The synopsis of the second-phase deployment is given in Algorithm \\ref{alg:eldwcc}.\n\\begin{algorithm}\n\\caption{: Second-phase Deployment.}\n\\label{alg:eldwcc}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n   \\STATE  {\\bf Input}:\n       \\STATE  {Locations of CHs, FPRNs and BS nodes.};\n   \\STATE  {\\bf Output}:\n   \\STATE { Locations $X_P$ of the SPRNs that maximize lifetime of B with connectivity and cost constraints.}\n   \\STATE  {\\bf begin}\n   \\STATE  $L_i$ $=$ Initial Laplacian from $B$;\n   \\STATE   $I_R$ $=$ Lifetime in the first-phase\n   \\STATE  $A_i$ $=$ adjacency matrix matching vertex i on the grid\n   \\STATE  Evaluate $\\mu_w\\left(G\\right)$;\n   \\STATE  $E_R$ $=$ number of rounds added by deploying SPRN on vertex i;\n   \\STATE  $WC$ $=$ $X_P$ from either DE or GSA\n%\\EndFunction\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\\section{Simulation Results}\nInitial experimental setup in MATLAB consists of nine cluster heads and one base station on predetermined grid locations. Nine initial CHs are deployed very close to their respective cluster members since sensor nodes have limited energy and low capabilities to transmit over far distances. For this reason, sensor nodes are only required to gather information of interest from their immediate environment. In the proposed deployment, the number of RNs is varied from 10 up to 50 for both optimization techniques. The normalized average distance deviation $\\left(\\Delta\\mu\\left(G\\right)\\right)$ is set to 0.1 in all the experiments. For the purpose of comparing these techniques, number of rounds is used as figure of merit for lifetime enhancement. .\\\\*[.2pc]\n\\indent\nIt is remarked that the lifetime derived in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq12}-\\eqref{MyEq15} is the number (in rounds) the network stays functional without partitioning. However, in reality the rounds depends on various ingredients such as network area, data generation rate of the sensor nodes, and amount of traffic handled by RNs virtue of their locations relative to the sink. The results presented are normalized to give a clearer and more distinct notion of energy efficiency achievable using these evolutionary techniques. \\\\*[.4pc]\n\\indent\nIn all the experiments, the maximum number of generations is set to 200. The population depends solely on the network size, that is, the size of the population grows linearly with network size. For each optimizer and network size pair, experiment was performed eight times to mitigate the effect of random initialization. It must be noted that network size here refers to number of backbone devices and optimization parameters are the off-diagonal elements of the Laplacian. The synopsis of number of parameters and iterations as the network size grows is shown in Table~(\\ref{table:result1}). Table~(\\ref{table:resultcomp}) gives the initial settings of each of the algorithms. For DE, $MP$ is mutation probability, $CP$ is crossover probability, and $F$ is a factor between 0 and 1. For GSA, $\\alpha$ is a positive constant that controls the gravitational speed, $\\epsilon$ is a small positive constant, $\\lambda$ is the division speed, $G_0$ is the gravitational constant, and $K_{best}$ is a set of best solutions. The results of the experiments are presented in Tables (\\ref{table:result2a}) and (\\ref{table:result2b}).\\\\*[.4pc]\n\\indent\n\\begin{table}[t] \\label{Table1}\n

experiments, the network size is 20 (1 BS, 9 CHs, and 10 RNs) and it is incremented by 10 up to 60 for subsequent experiments.\nThe result in Fig.~\\ref{Fig_9_Lambda} shows that overall network connectivity was preserved within desired range ($0.5$-$0.6$) specified by MST in Algorithm~\\ref{alg:MST}. Fig.~\\ref{Fig_6_mu} shows that all the techniques considered successfully minimize the average internode distance. However, it was observed that ABC-based deployment does not significantly improve as network size grows from 50 to 60. It is clear that DE-based deployment outperforms both ABC and GSA-based deployment in extending the useful network lifetime as vividly shown in Fig.~\\ref{Fig_8_TR}. When the packets per round is set to 30 and the network size is increased to 60, DE-based deployment achieves almost twice as GSA, and around $30\\%$ more than the ABC-based algorithm. Since network lifetime theoretically depends on the average inter-node distance as given in Eq. \\eqref{MyEq14}, it came as no surprise that all the three heuristic-based deployments extend the network lifetime considerably. The objective function values have been averaged over eight experiments and plotted against the number of iterations for visualization. As observed in Fig. \\ref{Fig_10_WG}, all heuristics minimize the cost function as expected. However, in most of the experiments, GSA got trapped in local minimum in less than 100 iterations, which is an indication of poor performance in comparison with DE and ABC. \\\\*[-.1pc]\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig_9_Lambda.pdf}\n  \\caption{Connectivity vs. network size}\\label{Fig_9_Lambda}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig_6_mu.pdf}\n  \\caption{Normalized average distance vs number of nodes}\\label{Fig_6_mu}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig_8_TR.pdf}\n  \\caption{Network Lifetime against size with traffic level = 30 packets per round}\\label{Fig_8_TR}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig_10_WG.pdf}\n  \\caption{Comparison between objectives $W\\left(G\\right)$}\\label{Fig_10_WG}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig_11_TR.pdf}\n  \\caption{Lifetime vs. Network load of ABC, GSA and DE}\\label{Fig_11_TR_ABC}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig_12_TR.pdf}\n  \\caption{Lifetime vs. Network load of ABC, GSA and DE}\\label{Fig_12_TR_DE}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Fig_13_TR.pdf}\n  \\caption{Lifetime vs. Network load of ABC, GSA and DE}\\label{Fig_13_TR_GSA}\n\\end{figure}\nThe scenario where more traffics are generated due to more deployed sensor nodes or increased data collection rate is also investigated. In this scenario, CHs/RNs have more data to relay back and forth among themselves and to BS. This increased traffic could arise as a result of extra package generated by new sensors. When network traffic was varied, an increase in energy usage for packets transmission and reception was observed. By proportion, a drastic drop in useful network lifetime was observed for all the three heuristic-based deployment strategies, as shown in Figs.~\\ref{Fig_11_TR_ABC}, \\ref{Fig_12_TR_DE}, \\ref{Fig_13_TR_GSA}. For DE-based algorithm, lifetime of approximately 17 rounds was obtained when the traffic was increased to 600ppr and network size to 60. On the other hand, ABC and GSA-based deployments only manage to achieve 13 and 8 rounds, respectively, with the same network configuration.\\\\*[.4pc]\n\\indent\nClose scrutiny of Tables (\\ref{table:result2a}) and (\\ref{table:result2b}) also reveals that, on average, the values observed in eight experiments are close to that observed in each individual experiment. This is an indication that the proposed deployment strategies are robust to different initial populations. In fact, it can be inferred from the p-value in Table~(\\ref{table:result2a}) that there is no significant difference between ABC and DE-based deployment for small-sized network ($N=20$). However, DE-based deployment is superior to that of GSA-based heuristic as inferred from the p-values. For large enough network ($N=30$ upward), DE-based deployment shows a significant improved performance than its counterparts.\n\n\\section{CONCLUSION}\nIn this paper, two other evolutionary techniques - Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and Differential Evolution (DE) are employed for RNs placement and qualitatively compared with existing placement solution that uses ABC. The proposed strategy has been developed and formulated as an optimization problem. The formulation stands on the premises that energy utilization of two communicating nodes depends not only on the distance and the traffic between them, but also on the complexity that arises in 3-D settings with huge search space and high computational cost. By using a two-tier two-phase architecture, the complexity of the deployment can be circumvented. MST is employed in the first phase to deploy the backbone devices with minimum connectivity. Then, DE and GSA are utilized to locate the optimal positions of second-phase relay nodes for lifetime maximization with guaranteed cost and connectivity constraints. It is concluded that DE is more efficient for relay node deployment in 3D settings than ABC and GSA as shown in the experimental results. In future, potential direction would be to investigate the effect of RN grid mobility on network lifetime enhancement and another interesting extension would be to investigate the effect of interference due to RN\'s wider range on network throughput.\n\n\\section*{Appendix}\n\\setcounter{table}{0}\n\\renewcommand{\\thetable}{A\\arabic{table}}\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n
