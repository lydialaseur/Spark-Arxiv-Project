In an AFM domain, the quantum version of the\nmagnetization order $m_i^z$ and N\\\'{e}el order $n_i^z$\n\\cite{Yuan2017direction} is\ngiven by the following expectation values:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_i^z = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle 0| \\sigma_i^z + \\sigma_{i+1}^z |0\\rangle,\nn_i^z = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle 0| \\sigma_i^z - \\sigma_{i+1}^z |0\\rangle, \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $i=1,3,5,...N-1$. Without ambiguity, the number of spins is\nassumed  even and $J=1.0$ if it is not stated otherwise.\n\n%\\section{Results and Discussions}\n\n%\\subsection{Intrinsic magnetization}\n%{\\it\\color{red}Intrinsic magnetization.---}\n\\vspace{6pt}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Domain wall properties.} Let us first look at\nthe numerical results, in the regime with weak anisotropy $g \\ll J$.\nFigure \\ref{fig1}a shows the spatial variation of $m_i^z$ and $n_i^z$\nfor $N=12$ (triangles), 16 (circles), 20 (squares), respectively.\nThese profiles are similar to those of classical AFM DWs. (1)\nThe N\\\'{e}el order $n_z$ has a typical classical DW profile whose\nvalue varies from 1 on the left hand side (LHS) of the chain to $-1$\non the right hand side (RHS). (2) The magnetization order $m_z$ is\nzero in the two domains and reaches its maximum at the DW center.\nAs the system becomes larger, the magnetic moments near the center\nbecome smaller, but, by summing all the magnetic moments in the DW,\nthe net magnetization is $m_t^z = 1/2$, independent of the system\nsize ($N$) as shown in the inset of Fig. \\ref{fig1}a.\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{fig1.eps}\\\\\n\\caption{\\textbf{Scheme of quantum domain walls.} (a) Spatial variation\nof $m^z$ (open symbols) and $n^z$ (filled symbols) for a spin chain\nwith $N=12$ (triangles), 16 (circles), 20 (squares), respectively.\nThe top-right inset shows the net magnetization as a function of $N$.\n$\\mathrm{pos} =i/N$ is the scaled position of the $i-$th site, $g=0.2.$\n(b) Scheme of the five degenerated low energy excitation states for $N=6$.\nThe blue (orange) background represents the net magnetization of the\ncorresponding state to be $S=1$ ($S=0$).}\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo further prove the result of $m_t^z = 1/2$, we look at the structure\nof a quantum DWs of $N$ spins. The boundary spins are aligned along\nthe $+z$ direction by the external fields. Given $g \\ll J$, the AFM\nexchange interaction dominates the Hamiltonian (\\ref{ham}).\nThus, the lowest energy states (i.e. ground-state) are those states\nwith only one pair of neighboring spins left alone (sketched as a\npair of parallel spins in Fig. \\ref{fig1}b) while rest nearest\nneighboring spins are anti-parallel with each other forming a zero spin\nsinglet state. For $N=6$, there are five such configurations of same\nenergy as sketched in Fig. \\ref{fig1}b. In general, there are $N-1$\nsuch states of energy $-(N-3)J$. These states can be further classified\ninto $|\\varphi^{S=1}_i \\rangle$ for $S=1$ and $|\\varphi^{S=0}_i \\rangle$\nfor $S=0$, $N/2$ for $S=1$ and the remaining for $S=0$, where $S$ is the\nnet magnetization of the system.\nThe true ground state under the boundary conditions is the linear\ncombination of this states. The corresponding eigenstate of the\nHamiltonian (\\ref{ham}) is\n\\begin{equation}\n|0_{\\mathrm{th}} \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N/2} a_i|\\varphi^{S=1}_i \\rangle\n+\\sum_{i=1}^{N/2-1} b_i|\\varphi^{S=0}_i\\rangle \\\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $a_i$,$b_i$ are the superposition coefficients.\nBy rearranging the basis states such that $S=1$ and $S=0$ states\nare ordered alternatively, the Hamiltonian (\\ref{ham}) can be recasted\nas a tridiagonal-Toeplitz matrix, where the ground state energy is found\nto be $E_0 = -(N-3)J - 2g \\cos \\left ( \\pi / N\\right )$ with the wave\nfunction\n\\begin{equation}\n|0_{\\mathrm{th} \\rangle} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}} \\left ( \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{N},\n\\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{N},..., \\sin \\frac{(N-1)\\pi}{N} \\right ),\n\\end{equation}\nNote that the anisotropy term $g$ only gives a first-order correction\nof the ground state energy. As a result, the magnetic moments distribution\nis given by $m_i^z=\\langle 0_{\\mathrm{th}}| \\sigma_i^z\n+ \\sigma_{i+1}^z |0_{\\mathrm{th}}\\rangle/2 = u_i$,\nwhere $u_i = 2/N\\sin^2 i\\pi/N$. The net magnetization can be calculated as\n\\begin{equation}\nm^z_t= \\sum_{\\mathrm{odd}~ i}^{N-1} u_i=\\frac{1}{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhich does not depend on $N$, in agreement with numerical results.\nThe essential physics is that the ground state is a superposition of\ntotal spin $S=1$ and $S=0$ configurations with equal contributions\n($\\sum u_{2i} = \\sum u_{2i+1}=1/2$) so that the average spin number is always 1/2.\n\n%\\noindent\\textbf{Chiral domain walls.}\nIn fact, the above result is also true when the Dzyaloshinsiki-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) \\cite{Dz1957, Moriya1960} $H_{\\mathrm{DM}}=-\\mathbf{D} \\cdot\n\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle} \\sigma_i \\times \\sigma_j$ is added to Hamiltonian\n(\\ref{ham}), where the ground state of the revised Hamiltonian is still\nsolvable analytically. Specifically, for $\\mathbf{D}=D\\hat{y}\\ (D>0)$,\nthe ground state is given by,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n|0_{\\mathrm{th}}\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{N}} \\left ( \\tau_1 \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{N},\n\\tau_2 \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{N},...,\n\\tau_{N-1}\\sin \\frac{(N-1)\\pi}{N} \\right ),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the prefactor $\\tau_i =1-2\\ \\mathrm{mod} ( \\lceil i/2 \\rceil,2)$,\n$\\lceil x \\rceil$ is the ceiling function of $x$.\nNote that $\\tau_i^2=1$, the magnetization distribution\n$m_i^z = 2/N \\sin^2 (i\\pi/N)$, is not changed by the DMI.\nHowever, the chirality of DW does depend on the sign of $D$.\nFor $D>0$, the system always prefers a clockwise N\\\'{e}el wall.\nHowever, if $D$ reverses the sign, the ground state becomes\ncounter-clockwise. This is consistent with classical case \\cite{yuan2017}.\n\n%\\subsection{Purity and global entanglement}\n%{\\it\\color{red}Entanglement.---}\n\\vspace{6pt}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Entanglement.} In quantum information science, the\npurity of the $i$-th spin is defined as $P_i =\\mathrm{tr}(\\rho_i^2)$\nwhere $\\rho_i$ is the density matrix of the $i$-th spin obtained by\ntracing all the other spins in the full density matrix $|0\\rangle\\langle0|$.\nIt quantifies the distance of a state relative to a pure state; for example,\nit takes the value 1 for a separable pure state, but 1/2 for a maximally\nentangled states such as Bell states and Greenberg-Horne-Zelinger state\n(GHZ) states \\cite{GHZ2007}.\n\nFigure \\ref{fig2}a shows the space distribution of purity as colored\nrectangles for $N=12$ (top inset), $16$ (middle inset), and $20$ (bottom inset),\nrespectively. Regardless of the system size, the purity takes 1 near\nthe boundary of spin chain and then decreases to form a symmetric dip\naround the chain center at $i/N=1/2$. The magnetization distribution\nof DWs takes on a peak centered at the dip position and its space\ndependence is strongly correlated with the purity. Physically, this\ncorrelation originates from the antiferromagnetic nature of nearest\nneighbour interaction. For the spins near the boundary, their directions\nare strongly bounded by the fixed orientations of the boundary spins\nand have a larger probability to be in N\\\'{e}el-state-like configurations.\nConsequently, the magnetization is close to zero and these spins are not\nentangled with the others (i.e., close to a pure state).\nThe spins near the center are influenced lightly by the boundary spins\nand their directions become much more uncertain, hence the purity of\nthese spins become smaller. The purity of spins close 1/2 at the wire center\n suggests that the spins inside the domain walls are highly entangled.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n  % Requires \\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{fig2.eps}\\\\\n\\caption{\\textbf{Tomography of quantum domain walls.}\n(a) Distribution of the magnetic moments of DWs for $N=12$ (triangles),\n$16$ (circles) and $20$ (squares), respectively. The solid lines are\nthe theoretical results given by $m_i^z =u_i$. The colored strips\nrepresent the distribution of purity at the corresponding $N$.\n(b) (c) Density of states tomography for a clockwise/counter-clockwise\nDW state in a spin chain with $N=6$. The values of vertical/horizontal\naxis represents the value of the basis vector by treating up spin as\nbit 0 and down spin as bit 1. The inset sketches the DW profile.}\n\\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTheoretically, the purity of the $i-$th spin is defined by the\nreduced density operator of the  $i-$th spin obtained by tracing\nall the spins except the $i-$th spin in density operator\n$|0_{\\mathrm{th}} \\rangle \\langle 0_{\\mathrm{th}} |$ as\n\\begin{equation}\nP_i^{\\mathrm{th}} =\\left (\\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} u_k \\right )^2\n+ \\left(\\sum_{k=i}^{N-1} u_k \\right)^2 + 2u_i u_{i-1},\n\\label{purity}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $i=1,2,...,N$. The third term $u_i u_{i-1}$ is of the order\n$O(1/N^2)$, which is much smaller than the first two terms.\nConsidering $\\sum u_i=1$, $P_i$ reaches its minimum value\n(1/2) at $i = N/2$, i.e. the chain center, where\n$m_i^z = u_i \\propto \\sin^2 (i\\pi/N)$ reaches its maximum value.\n\nThe correlations of the magnetization distribution and purity distribution\ncan be extended to two dimensions (2D) where rich magnetic structures\nsuch as vortices, skyrmions can exist since the physics remain the same.\nNevertheless, it is a great challenge to find the ground states in 2D\nboth analytically and numerically. %As a preliminary extension, we\n%arrange the 1D spin chain with DMI in an axle-like way (See the\n%Supplemental Materials for details) and plot the magnetization\n%distribution and purity distribution in Supplement. Both distributions\n%takes on a clear skyrmion profile.\nPractically, the correlations also allow us to measure a quantum DW, vortices\nand even skyrmions by measuring the purity of each spin in a spin chain. \nThe later can be realized by performing state tomography on each system \nqubit or by a more efficient technique that uses bitwise interactions \nbetween the system and identically prepared registers \\cite{Brennen2003}.\nA typical tomography of the density of states for a clockwise/counter-clockwise\nDW is shown in Fig. \\ref{fig2}b and \\ref{fig2}c. The distinguishable\ndistributions of the density matrix allows us to classify clockwise and\ncounter-clockwise DWs.\n\nFurthermore, the direct sum of magnetization recovers the net magnetization\nof the spin chain while the proper average of the local purity can\ngive the global entanglement ($E_g$) of the spins. The original definition\nof $E_g$ is given by Meyer and Wallach \\cite{Meyer2002} and then\nreformulated in terms of the sum of local purity \\cite{Brennen2003}, i.e.\n\n\\begin{equation}\nE_g \\equiv \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (1-P_i).\n\\end{equation}\nSubstituting Eq. (\\ref{purity}) into this definition, the leading order\nof global entanglement is reduced to\n\\begin{equation}\nE_g = 2 - \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\left [ \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} u_i \\right)^2\n+ \\left(\\sum_{i=k}^{N-1} u_i \\right )^2 \\right ].\n\\end{equation}\nThe sum increases as $N$ increases and saturates for $N>20$. The limiting\nvalue is $E_g = 2/3-5/2\\pi^2 \\approx 0.41$. This indicates that the\nspins in a DW is still entangled in the macroscopic scale\n($N\\rightarrow \\infty $). This is quite different from a classic DW\nthat has zero entanglement since all its composite spins have definite\norientations.\n\nAs a comparison, for a quantum domain state without DWs such as the\nsuperposition of two degenerated N\\\'{e}el states,\n\\begin{equation}\n|0_{\\mathrm{th}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (|\\uparrow \\downarrow \\uparrow \n\\downarrow...\\uparrow \\downarrow \\rangle\n+ \\right |\\downarrow \\uparrow \\downarrow \\uparrow ...\\downarrow \\uparrow \\rangle)\n\\label{neel}\n\\end{equation}\nThe global entanglement is $E_g = 1$ while its net magnetization is zero.\nBased on this comparison, it becomes possible to distinguish domain and\nDW states and the corresponding net magnetization by measuring the\nglobal entanglement of the spin system.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\centering\n  % Requires \\usepackage{graphicx}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{fig3.eps}\\\\\n\\caption{\\textbf{Phase diagram and the characterization of the phase\ntransition using entanglement.} (a) The distribution of net magnetization\nof the spin chain ($|\\mathrm{m}^z|$) in the $h - g$ phase space.\nThe $\\pm$ signs represent clockwise and counter-clockwise DW respectively.\n$N=12$.\n(b) Simulated global entanglement ($E_g$) distribution in the $h - g$ phase space.\n(c) Global entanglement ($E_g$) as a function of boundary field ($h$). $g = 0.2$.\nLeft inset: $dE_g/dh$ as a function of external field for\n$N=8,10,12,14,16$, respectively.

For a typical magnetic material, $k_B/J = 600$ K, then the figure\n%clearly indicates the existence of entanglement at the room temperature ($T=300$ K).\n%This may be due to the topological stability of the quantum DWs against the temperature.\n\n\n\\vspace{6pt}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Phase transition.} To know the size of the phase space\nwhere the quantum DWs are stable, it is interesting to plot the phase\ndiagram of the spin model. In our numerical simulation, we fix the\nexchange coupling and adjust the anisotropy $g$ and boundary fields to\nobtain various ground states in $h-g$ plane as shown in Fig. \\ref{fig3}.\n\nGuided by the red line in Fig. \\ref{fig3}a, the ground state changes\nfrom a single domain state to a quantum DW at the critical field of\n$h_c = J$ for $g=0$. The critical field has a non-trivial\ndependence on $g$ and $h$. For simplicity, we focus on the regime\n$g \\ll 1$, where the ground state is mainly determined by the\ncompetition of exchange interaction and Zeeman interaction.\nIn this regime, the global entanglement ($E_g$) shows an abrupt\njump from 1.0 to a smaller value as shown in \\ref{fig3}b and\nFig. \\ref{fig3}c with $g=0.2$. This abrupt change is due to the\ndistinguishable quantum properties of the domains and DWs.\nWhen $h <h_c$, the exchange interaction dominates the Hamiltonian\nand the ground state is a superposition of two degenerated N\\\'{e}el\nstates Eq. (\\ref{neel}) with $E_g=1$. The numerical value of $E_g$\nis a little smaller than the theoretical value 1, as shown in\nFig. \\ref{fig3}c, due to the influence of the small anisotropy $g$\nterm, which tendency is to align all the spins to $x$ direction and\nreduce the entanglement. As the field increases above $h_c$,\nthe ground state becomes a DW state with finite entanglement 0.41\nas discussed previously.\n\nThe global entanglement and its first derivative is continuous with $h$\nnear the critical field while its second order derivative is discontinuous,\nas shown in the left inset of Fig. \\ref{fig3}c. To verify whether this\ndiscontinuity can be a good indictor of the phase transition, we first\nplot the first derivative of $E_g$ versus $h$ in the left inset of Fig.\n\\ref{fig3}c for system size ranging from $N=8, 10, 12, 14,16$.\nAs $N$ increases, $dE_g/dh$ shows a clear divergence tendency at the critical field.\nTo eliminate the finite size effect, we do scaling analysis for finite systems\nusing the scaling ansatz \\cite{Osterloh2002},\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dE_g}{dh}=\\ln N^\\nu |h-h_c|,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\nu$ is the critical exponent. As shown in the right inset of\nFig. \\ref{fig3}c, $\\nu =0.54$ gives perfect scaling results for the\nfinite systems. This consistency shows that global entanglement is a\ngood measure of quantum DW/domain phase transition in this system.\n\n%\\section{Conclusions}\n%{\\it\\color{red}Conclusions.---}\n\\vspace{6pt}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Discussion}\n\n\\noindent We have shown that an AFM DW in a 1D lattice has an intrinsic\nmagnetization of 1/2 independent of lattice length. The reason is that\nthe ground state is a superposition of $S=1$ states and $S=0$ states\nof equal amplitude. The global entanglement of such a DW is non-zero\nand even exists at a macroscopic scale. Moreover, the magnetization\nprofile is closely related to the local purity of spins such that the\nDW width can be extracted from the purity profile that can be measured\nthrough state tomography in quantum information science.\nThe typical energy gap of the ground state and the first excited state\nin our model is $43 ~\\mu\\mathrm{eV}$ ($\\sim 500$ mK) for $N=20$.\nThen the mixture of excited states and ground state can be neglected\nat a temperature below 500 mK, which leaves a sufficient room to\nexperimentally verify our theoretical prediction.\n\nSince our results are applicable to chiral DWs due to DMI, the main\nconclusions can be generalized to two dimensional case for magnetic\nskyrmions. This type of skyrmions has non-zero entanglement that is\nvery different from the classical skyrmions discussed in literature.\nFurther study of the quantum skyrmions may lead to\nquantum skyrmion spintronics.\n%\\section{Acknowledgement}\n\n\\vspace{6pt}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Methods}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Lanczos algorithm.}\nOur numerical calculation of the ground states of the spin model are\nbased on the Lanczos method. First, a random initial state\n$| \\psi_0 \\rangle$ is chosen in the $2^N$ dimensional Hilbert space.\nThen we define a new state $| \\psi_1 \\rangle$ that is orthogonal to\n$| \\psi_0 \\rangle$, realized by subtracting\n$\\mathcal{H} | \\psi_0 \\rangle$ over $| \\psi_0 \\rangle$ i.e.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n| \\psi_1 \\rangle = \\mathcal{H} | \\psi_0 \\rangle -  a_0| \\psi_0 \\rangle\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $a_0 = \\langle \\psi_0 | \\mathcal{H} | \\psi_0 \\rangle / \\langle \\psi_0|\\psi_0 \\rangle$.\nNext, we define the state $|\\psi_2\\rangle $ that is orthogonal to both $|\\psi_0 \\rangle $ and\n$|\\psi_1 \\rangle $,\n\\begin{equation}\n| \\psi_2 \\rangle = \\mathcal{H} | \\psi_1 \\rangle - a_1 | \\psi_1 \\rangle - b_0 | \\psi_0 \\rangle\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $a_1 = \\langle \\psi_1 | \\mathcal{H} | \\psi_1 \\rangle / \\langle \\psi_1|\\psi_1 \\rangle$,\n$b_0 = \\langle \\psi_1|\\psi_1 \\rangle /\\langle \\psi_0|\\psi_0 \\rangle$.\nThrough iterations, the state $|\\psi_{n+1} \\rangle$ is derived as\n\\begin{equation}\n| \\psi_{n+1} \\rangle = \\mathcal{H} | \\psi_n \\rangle - a_n | \\psi_n \\rangle - b_{n-1} | \\psi_{n-1} \\rangle,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the coefficients $a_n = \\langle \\psi_n | \\mathcal{H} | \\psi_n \\rangle / \\langle \\psi_n|\\psi_n \\rangle$,\n$b_{n-1} = \\langle \\psi_n|\\psi_n \\rangle /\\langle \\psi_{n-1}|\\psi_{n-1} \\rangle$.\n\nIn terms of the mutual orthogonal basis spanned by $\\{|\\psi_0\\rangle, |\\psi_1\\rangle,...|\\psi_n\\rangle \\}$,\nthe Hamiltonian can be written in the form of a tridiagonal matrix\nand then diagonalized through the standard subroutine.\nThe ground state energy $E_n$ is obtained as the smallest eigenvalues\nof the Hamiltonian. As $n$ increases, the $E_n$ will converge to the\nreal ground state energy of the system while the corresponding eigen-vector\nis the wave function of ground states. The convergence criteria used in the\nsimulations is $|E_n - E_{n-1}| \\leq 10^{-14}$.\n\n\n\n\\vspace{6pt}\n%\\noindent \\textbf{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n%\\bibitem{MacDonald2008} P.
